<h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h3>

<p class="p2">For the past eleven years Professor Howard H. Quint has
been a member of the faculty of the University of South
Carolina where he specialized in the teaching of American
constitutional and intellectual history. Because he believed
that this book should be published but did not wish to cause
embarrassment to the University of South Carolina, a state-supported
institution, he resigned his position prior to publication.</p>

<p>Professor Quint was graduated from Yale University in 1940
and was awarded an M.A. degree from Stanford University
and a Ph.D. degree from The Johns Hopkins University. During
World War <abbr title="Two">II</abbr> he was associated with the Foreign Broadcast
Intelligence Service as a propaganda analyst and with
the Office of Strategic Services as a political and economic
analyst. In 1954 he won second place in an American Historical
Association competition for the John H. Dunning Prize. In
1956 he was Smith-Mundt lecturer in United States history at
the National University of Mexico.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class="p2">Although this book deals with South Carolina, it is in effect a
study of the Deep South. What is happening in the Palmetto State
is fairly typical of the situation in other Southern states where segregation,
bigotry and prejudice remain deeply entrenched.</p>

<p>To judge by what Prof. Quint points out in this highly discerning
book, the situation in South Carolina hasn’t improved materially
since the Supreme Court of the land ruled, in its historic decision
of May 17, 1954, that students in publicly supported educational
institutions may not be segregated because of race, creed, or color.
A worsening rather than improving racial situation is indeed reflected
by the views expressed by officials, newspaper editors, voluntary organizations
and individual citizens, Negro and white, as cited in this
book.</p>

<p>Although Prof. Quint handles his material with admirable restraint,
the reader, even if he is personally attached to the state,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is likely to
pronounce South Carolina’s record a melancholy one. Is the state
behaving responsibly when it denies the law of the land, busies itself
with contriving means of avoidance, threatens instead of addressing
itself to the manifest mandate? When it revives the plea of peculiarity
does it remember its own history of nullification and secession? Is
it never to reject the demagogue who proclaims exploded notions of
race and distorts the Constitution of the United States? In the interval
for reformation which the Supreme Court has wisely allowed must
South Carolina indulge bluster and vituperation in place of summoning
candor and courage? Have ignorance, poverty, and prejudice
fed on each other until the white community has sunk to second-rate
capacity?</p>

<p>Consider the spectacle of an ancient commonwealth in delirium because
a black child knocks on a schoolhouse door. What are the
causes of this fury? They are many, but the chief is that the applicant
for equal opportunity is now in a superior legal and moral
position. It is the Negro who rests upon rights, to be claimed through
orderly processes. He leaves desperate remedies to those who refuse
him. In the rap on the door sound the measured tones of judges, the
command of the President of the United States and the voice of the
nation. Echoes too the demand of deprived peoples in many countries.</p>

<p>More solemn than all these is the call of conscience of South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
Carolina. Immemorial wrongs are at length to be redressed—gradually,
painfully, surely. Some will say that the conscience of the
state is dead, that to invoke it is delusion. If that is true, no solution
offers except coercion, while we entertain the hope that prudent acquiescence
will substitute for more valorous self-correction. If the
white people of South Carolina furnish no worthy response in the
crisis, then humiliation and rehabilitation by other hands is their
portion.</p>

<p>In spite of the discouraging showing to date, one awaits a better
prospect. Patience, double patience, in the cure of long-standing
ills is the obvious counsel. Though South Carolina has had ample
warning, public opinion reflects a state of shock. Additional time
(but how long, oh Lord, how long?) for readjustment will bring the
problem into truer focus. Extravagant allegations still industriously
pressed will inevitably be discredited. Who can believe that the Supreme
Court is Communist-controlled or that segregation in the
schools is the bulwark of racial purity? As other states conform to
the court decree and their experience is that the heavens do not fall,
fanciful terrors will subside. New leaders will bid for support, persons
not pledged to fierce intolerance.</p>

<p>Healthy elements deserve to be nursed. Wholesale condemnation,
besides being inapplicable, will act to bring support to the violent,
the confused, the cruel. A state may not be disparaged into compliance.</p>

<p>The truly restorative ingredients are within. That they will be
roused and meet the nation’s demand there can be no doubt. Prof.
Quint’s book makes this amply evident.</p>

<p>Some may feel that the author is much too critical and outspoken.
I disagree. While I don’t go along with everything that Prof. Quint
says, I am inclined to feel that his book needed to be written; too
many things have been left unsaid too long. It’s time that South
Carolina—that, indeed, the entire South—face up, boldly and realistically,
to their problems. I commend this book to every Southerner
and to every American.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>This is a book about race relations in the sovereign state of South
Carolina. It gives particular attention to the lengths to which white
South Carolinians are willing to go to maintain a caste system of
society. And it shows why South Carolina, the prototype of every
Deep South state, is not likely to surrender without a catastrophic
struggle to accepting the proposition that the Negro is a free individual
in a free society with the same rights and privileges as every
other American.</p>

<p>In South Carolina, the race issue has always been emphasized in
its most exaggerated form and the Negro has helped to create what
has become a peculiar and almost unique state of mind. In many
respects the state’s history has been little less than a chronicle of the
white population’s reactions to the problems created by the presence
of a large number of Negroes—a case of the tail wagging the dog. In
1921 Professor Francis B. Simkins considered South Carolina’s failure
“to keep abreast of her sister states in non-partisan and classless progress”
as intelligible and explainable “only in the light of the perennial
fear of disturbing inter-racial harmony.” The state’s “proud
record in interracial harmony,” he noted, was based on a policy of
“absolute white supremacy.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Similarly, the late W. W. Ball, the
Charleston champion of aristocratic conservatism, believed that “socially
and politically the presence of this race in majority” was perhaps
the ruling factor in the state’s progress or want of it.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Summarizing
the stand of South Carolina and the South on the decision of the
Supreme Court to end racial segregation in public schools, R. Beverly
Herbert, a Columbia attorney, expressed the same idea. “A deep
sense of race and race preservation,” he wrote, “has influenced and in
many cases controlled the South throughout her history.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I feel compelled to state at the outset certain basic assumptions
upon which this study is premised. I believe that the abolition of
racial segregation in public schools and public facilities is a desirable
end; that Southerners in defending such segregation in the 1950’s are
fighting the tide of history just as surely as their forefathers did in
defending human bondage a century ago; and that the Negro’s drive
to end this segregation will eventually be successful. I recognize the
tremendous difficulties presented by this problem due to long established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
mores and realize that it cannot be solved quickly and without
a certain amount of social friction and resentment.</p>

<p>This investigation reveals a way of thinking that is in a sense
foreign to most non-Southerners and I ask of the latter patience,
understanding and tolerance. But I feel that constructive rather
than obstructive action must be taken and that compliance with
rather than defiance of the Supreme Court’s verdict must be the
rule. I particularly deplore the disrespect for federal law which is
inherent in the official policy of the State of South Carolina. In
some ways this is the most ominous development of the past few
years. In all phases of this investigation I have striven for objectivity
and endeavored first and foremost to allow South Carolinians,
both white and Negro, to speak for themselves and thereby to express
the communal psychology of the state.</p>

<p>Since this study leans heavily on certain South Carolina newspapers,
it is appropriate to point out the following about these papers:</p>

<p>The <cite>Charleston News and Courier</cite>, the largest and probably the
most influential of those studied, reflects the sentiments of the most
extreme segregationists in the state. Conservative, if not downright
reactionary, not only on the race issue but in all political, economic
and social questions, the Charleston paper advocates resistance to
the Court decisions to the point of defiance of federal authority.
The editor of the paper is Thomas R. Waring.</p>

<p>While under the editorship of able Jack H. O’Dowd, the <cite>Florence
Morning News</cite> was the most reasonable and constructive daily in
the state with regard to the segregation problem. An advocate of
“militant moderation” and an opponent of both white supremacists
and the NAACP, O’Dowd became the state’s most controversial
editor, subject for the wrath of ardent segregationists. Finally succumbing
to pressures, he resigned the editorship in August 1956. His
successor, James A. Rogers, is an “orthodox” segregationist.</p>

<p>Controlled by the same company that publishes the morning Columbia
<cite>State</cite>, the Columbia <cite>Record</cite>, an afternoon newspaper, accepts
prevailing views on the race issue, though in considerably less extreme
form than the <cite>Charleston News and Courier</cite>. Also staunchly
conservative, the <cite>Record</cite> leans toward the Republican Party. As of
the beginning of this year, the <cite>Record’s</cite> editor, George A. Buchanan,
became Dean of the University of South Carolina School of Journalism.</p>

<p>Decidedly anti-integrationist, the Anderson <cite>Independent</cite> is less concerned
with the race issue than the other papers studied. This is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
part a reflection of its upcountry location. The <cite>Independent</cite> represents
to some degree the New-Fair Deal elements in the state and is
an outspoken advocate of loyalty to the national Democratic Party.
Editor of the paper is L. S. Embree.</p>

<p>These newspapers represent a cross section of the press in South
Carolina both geographically and ideologically. Moreover, a study of
additional newspapers would not change appreciably, if at all, the
basic patterns. (As far as I am aware, there is only one paper in
South Carolina which advocates compliance with the Supreme Court’s
1954 decision. This is the <cite>Cheraw Chronicle</cite>, edited and published by
a young and courageous North Carolinian, Andrew McDowd Secrest.)</p>

<p>Other sources, notably periodical literature, the proceedings of the
General Assembly of South Carolina, and the Columbia <cite>State</cite> have
been used to a limited extent. For the sake of brevity the newspapers
are referred to throughout the text simply as the <cite>News and
Courier</cite>, the <cite>Record</cite>, the <cite>Morning News</cite> and the <cite>Independent</cite>.</p>

<p>The author is a native of Connecticut who has lived over a decade
in South Carolina. But this book could not have been written without
the assistance of a young scholar who is a Southerner. Legitimately
his name should be on the title page but he desires for personal
reasons to remain anonymous. Both the research for and a preliminary
draft of a major portion of this study were done by him and
I wish now to acknowledge this fact and also my obligation to him.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER <abbr title="One">I</abbr></h4>
<h3>THE DEVELOPMENT OF RACE RELATIONSHIPS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent10 unindent">Emancipation, itself, would not satisfy these fanatics.
That gained, the next step would be to raise the Negroes
to a social and political equality with the whites.—<cite>John
C. Calhoun</cite></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p class="p2">The present pattern of race relations for South Carolina was shaped
in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. In 1877 at the end of
the Reconstruction period the mould of segregation had yet to be rigidly
defined. Only in the last decade of the century was absolute segregation
established. During the Reconstruction years public schools were
not integrated, although Negro students attended the state university.
In personal and social relationships segregation was generally practiced
but more on the basis of social custom than by force of legislation.
Largely if not entirely ignored was the Civil Rights law which had
been passed by the Reconstruction legislature. This law, which remained
on the statute books until 1889, prohibited racial discrimination
by “common carriers or by any person engaged in a business, calling
or pursuit” for which a federal, state or municipal license was required.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In the political area the establishing of Jim Crowism was slower
though no less effective and complete in its end result. Negroes voted
until the 1890’s and were influential in the local government of several
counties. South Carolina sent three Negro congressmen to Washington
after 1876; one served until 1896. In 1882 nine Negroes sat in the state
legislature, the last Negro member of that body being defeated for reelection
in 1902. Yet these were the exception and not the rule for the
Negro was in truth virtually eliminated as a factor in state politics
by the end of the 1880’s. With the restrictions on Negro suffrage contained
in the new state constitution of 1895 and the adoption of the
Democratic Party primary the following year, the Negro was prevented
from voting in the state. Yet, in spite of the Negro’s all but complete
disfranchisement, the fear that he might be used for political purposes
“prevented the whites from dividing into two parties or from breaking
out of the restrictions imposed by the Democratic primary.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>With the disfranchisement of the Negro, the repeal of the state Civil
Rights law and the establishment of absolute and legalized segregation,
a rigid system of caste based on race materialized as a means of race<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
control.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It was reflected in the segregation of schools, churches, and
other public and private organizations and institutions. The two
races seldom came into contact except in the relationship of employer
and laborer. In no sense was the concept of racial equality accepted
by the dominant whites.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The maintenance of absolute segregation frequently necessitated
resort to either the threat or use of force or violence. The threat was
ever present in the personal, economic, and political relationships between
the races. Fear of slave insurrections was replaced by fear of
a “vague and unknown thing,” social equality. As the nineteenth
century ground to an end, application of violence was frequently approved
by “respectable” whites, especially if Negroes were suspected
or charged with murder or rape. The Charleston <cite>News and Courier</cite>,
for example, argued that the lynching of a suspected murderer was
“not mob law.” According to the paper’s editorialist, “the brute placed
himself outside the pale of the law and was dealt with accordingly.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Segregation of the races in the state has been both a manifestation of
belief in racial superiority and a basic distrust of democracy. Ben
Tillman interpreted his election as governor as a triumph of “white
supremacy over mongrelism and anarchy.” In his inaugural address
he denied “without regard to color that ‘all men are created equal.’”
It was not true then and it was not true when Jefferson wrote it, he
thundered.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Carlyle McKinley, associate editor of the <cite>News and
Courier</cite>, wrote in the 1880’s that in “works of art, skill, science, invention,
literature, in the whole field of human enterprise, endeavor,
design and discovery, in every respect that can be named, the Negro
is far behind the lowliest families of the white race.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The late W. W.
Ball, among other things editor of the <cite>News and Courier</cite> and Dean of
the School of Journalism of the University of South Carolina, declared
that “every decent white man and woman” in the state maintained
and exercised the “right of treating all Negroes as inferiors.” In one
of his characteristic diatribes against democracy, he wrote that “universal
and unrestricted suffrage” was unthinkable. Safety demanded
that South Carolina “steer away from the infatuation even of universal
white democracy.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In 1944, twenty-five years after Ball made the above statement,
the state House of Representatives adopted a resolution which “indignantly
and vehemently” denounced all organizations seeking “the
amalgamation of the white and Negro races by co-mingling of the
races on any basis of equality.” Such were deemed “hostile to the
existence and preservation of the American Union of States.” Simultaneously,
the legislators reaffirmed their belief in and allegiance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
“established white supremacy,” and pledged “our lives and our sacred
honor to maintaining it, whatever the cost.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In no other area have South Carolinians been so sensitive to outside
criticism as on the race issue. After the end of Reconstruction “outside
agitation” on racial problems was infrequent. It became even
less so after the Supreme Court in 1896 gave official legal blessing to
racial segregation in the <cite>Plessy v. Ferguson</cite> decision. However in
the 1930’s and during the Second World War, “agitation” was renewed
for more civil rights for the Southern Negro. This agitation inspired
passage of the above cited resolution by the state legislature. The
latter demanded, “firmly and unequivocally,” that “henceforth the
damned agitators of the North leave the South alone.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<h4><abbr title="Two"><span class="allsmcap">II</span></abbr></h4>

<p>Elimination of the Negro from state politics became an article of
faith, a factor of transcendant importance in the preservation of white
supremacy. The instrumentality through which the Negro was effectively
excluded from the suffrage was the Democratic Party primary
which was adopted in 1896. Not until the late 1940’s was the Democratic
primary opened to Negro voters and then only by direction of
the federal courts.</p>

<p>Up to the New Deal period the South Carolina white primary faced
little real “danger” either from “outside agitators” or homegrown
“radicals.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Yet a disruptive force was at work. This was the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People which
slowly but relentlessly was seeking to break down the restrictions
placed on Negro suffrage. An initial breach, which did not directly
affect South Carolina, had come with the ruling by the Supreme Court
in 1915 that the “grandfather clause” was unconstitutional. South
Carolina reacted to these developments by strengthening its determination
to maintain and re-enforce the white primary. One venerable
device in this effort was the poll tax which, of course, not only disfranchised
a mass of Negro voters but many whites as well. White
South Carolinians were willing to pay this price, however, to guarantee
the white primary. Toward the same end other devices were resorted
to as grounds for disfranchisement such as lengthy residence requirements,
discretionary educational requirements, property qualifications
and numerous petty crimes, supposedly common among Negroes.</p>

<p>Lack of organized opposition made control of the Democratic
primary tantamount to control of the state government. Such control
traditionally resided in the hands of politicians whose defeats resulted
not in the extension of democracy but simply in the creation of a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
faction to direct state politics. With great effectiveness politicians
used fear of the Negro vote to forestall development of an operative
two party system. They contended that a two-party system would
split the white vote and thus allow the Negroes to hold the balance
of political power. In opposing the repeal of the poll tax, a member
of the 1944 state House of Representatives said that Negroes were
“trying to vote” and if the suffrage were made too easy a two party
system would surely result. To prevent both, he concluded, it was
imperative to keep the Democratic Party all powerful.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Nor did
this feeling end with the abolition of the white primary. In 1952
Governor James F. Byrnes, taking note of the increasing registration
of Negro voters, lamented that there would always be white politicians
in the state “willing to enter into secret political trades” for Negro
votes. Such men had to be “watched” and those who were willing
to deal with Negro leaders had to be defeated.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In 1956 Governor
George Bell Timmerman, Jr., said that a two party system would
bring South Carolina “nothing but permanent strife and damage.” It
had brought chaos to the North “where minorities are pawns and
politics is played with the lives of small children for the sake of a
vote,” asserted the governor. He for one was “not prepared to turn
the state Democratic Party over to any radical element or other irresponsible
group.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Increased “agitation” for Negro civil rights in the New Deal and
World War <abbr title="Two">II</abbr> periods eventuated in the end of the white primary.
This disaster was the result of several federal court decisions, notably
in the cases of <cite>Smith v. Allwright</cite> (1944), <cite>Rice v. Elmore</cite> (1947) and
<cite>Brown v. Baskin</cite> (1948). The first and most important of these was
a Texas case in which the Supreme Court declared all suffrage restrictions
premised on race to be unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Reaction of the white leaders of South Carolina to the <cite>Smith v.
Allwright</cite> decision was instantaneous. Officials, public figures, and
private citizens lost no opportunity to condemn it. The late Senator
Burnet R. Maybank, aware that the decision was not an isolated incident
but part of the developing effort to break down white supremacy,
declared that regardless of any Supreme Court decision and any laws
that might be passed by Congress, South Carolinians would maintain
those political and social institutions which were “in the best interest
of our people.” White South Carolinians would “treat the Negro
fairly,” said the Senator, but they did “not intend for him to take over
our election system or attend our white schools.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The then Governor Olin D. Johnston, not to be outdone, called a
special session of the state legislature to meet the “emergency.” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
recommended that the legislators repeal all state laws dealing with
primary elections, thus giving the Democratic Party the status of a
private club. This maneuver, he believed, would put the party outside
the jurisdiction of federal courts. Should it prove inadequate, he
announced, South Carolinians would “use the necessary methods to
retain white supremacy in our primaries and to safeguard the homes
and happiness of our people.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The legislature, following his advice,
completely divorced the state from all legal connections with the
Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party of South Carolina itself took action to nullify
the effects of the court decision. If Negroes could not be legally
barred from primary election, they would be excluded from party
membership. A state Democratic convention, held shortly after the
decision, adopted a rule which provided that to be eligible for membership
in the party, a person had to be a “white Democrat” who subscribed
to the principles of the Democratic Party of South Carolina as
declared by the state convention.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In 1947 the newly enacted defenses for white supremacy in the
Democratic primary were tested in federal district court and found
wanting. George A. Elmore, under NAACP auspices, brought suit
against the Democratic Party. He claimed that its recent actions
deprived him of his right to vote. Federal District Judge J. Waties
Waring<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> agreed and ruled against the state of South Carolina and
the Democratic Party. In admonishing South Carolina to “rejoin
the union,” he declared racial discriminations illegal in the machinery
that selected the officers and lawmakers of the United States. All
citizens were entitled to cast a “free and untrammelled” vote in the
election. If “the only material and realistic elections” were “clothed
with the name ‘primary,’” said the judge, they were no less equally
entitled to vote in them.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In the face of the decision, the harrassed and beleaguered state
Democratic Party took two important steps to insure continuation
of the white primary. By the first a dual system of voting qualifications
was established which sought to disbar most Negro voters. Concomitantly
a lengthy oath, designed to discourage Negro voters and
required of all voters, was adopted. It compelled the voter to swear
that he understood, believed in, and supported “the principles of the
Democratic Party of South Carolina,” the “social, religious, and educational
separation of the races,” and “the principles of states rights,”
and was opposed to the “proposed federal so-called FEPC law.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>These restrictions were quickly brought to a court test. In a second
decision, in the case of <cite>Brown v. Baskin</cite>, Judge Waring invalidated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the white primary. In a pointed and sharply worded opinion he termed
the dual system of voting qualifications “a clear and flagrant evasion
of the law” as enunciated in earlier court rulings against suffrage restrictions
on the basis of race. He also branded the oath required of
all voters in the primary as a “flagrant disregard of the rights of
American citizens to exercise their own views and opinions.” The
oath was patently unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The United States Supreme
Court refused to review either of Judge Waring’s decisions, thus in
effect upholding them.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Judge Waring, a prominent Charlestonian, was condemned on all
sides by white South Carolinians. His decisions were likewise criticized.
After the ruling in <cite>Brown v. Baskin</cite>, Representative William
Jennings Bryan Dorn asked Congress to investigate Judge Waring’s
“conduct in office.” Under his ruling, said Dorn, “a Communist, a
Negro, a Fascist, or a Republican could vote in the Democratic Party
of South Carolina.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<h4><abbr title="Three"><span class="allsmcap">III</span></abbr></h4>

<p>Traditionally orthodoxy on the race issue has transcended all other
considerations in South Carolina politics. Consequently the state has
had more than its fair share of zealots willing to play the race issue for
the last ounce of its political worth. Even those most outspoken on
the issue have not been free of charges of racial heresy. In the 1938
senatorial election Olin D. Johnston, attempting unsuccessfully to unseat
“Cotton Ed” Smith, charged that the Senator had not always been
anti-Negro. “Why, Ed Smith voted for a bill that would permit a
big buck nigger to sit by your wife or sister on a railroad train,” he
cried. But Smith was able to use the attack on him by Roosevelt
and Northern liberals with telling effect. He boasted that he had
walked out of the 1936 Democratic National Convention when a
Negro minister was asked to pray. The purpose of that prayer, he
declared, was “not to ask divine assistance but to invoke colored votes.”
“White supremacy, that time honored tradition,” bellowed the Senator
in a campaign speech, could “no more be blotted out of the hearts of
South Carolinians” than could the “scars which Sherman’s artillery
left on the State House at Columbia.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>During the 1930’s and 1940’s under encouragement given their aspirations
by the New and Fair Deals, South Carolina Negroes became
Democrats in theory and in fact. Their most ambitious political undertaking
was the formation in 1944 of the Progressive Democratic
Party under the leadership of John McCray, a newspaperman, and
James M. Hinton, a minister and insurance saleman. The Progressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Democrats supported the national Democratic Party but opposed that
of the state.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The Progressive Democrats had little success. David
Duncan Wallace, the historian of South Carolina, estimated that only
about 3,500 Negroes voted in the presidential election of 1944 and
about 5,000 in 1948. In the latter year the Progressive Democrats
sent a slate of delegates to the national party convention and unsuccessfully
challenged the regular state Democrats.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> A similar attempt
in 1956 also failed.</p>

<p>The increasing role of the Negro in South Carolina politics has had
the effect of spotlighting such issues as civil rights, FEPC, and states
rights. The white majority remains as determined as ever to maintain
“the Southern way of life” and every inch of ground is yielded grudgingly.
The race question is applied to nearly every political issue,
either openly or covertly, and all-out attempts have been—and to be
sure, still are—made to discredit any proposal or policy that would
alter the <i lang="la">status quo</i>. The most popular method has been that of
equating unpopular measures with communism, atheism, racial “mongrelization,”
etc. Sometimes the results have been ludicrous. In his
unsuccessful 1950 campaign for the United States Senate, Governor
J. Strom Thurmond asserted that had President Truman “not been
so busy playing Negro politics,” the nation would not have been involved
in the Korean situation.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Favorite targets in the 1940’s were
President Truman’s civil rights bill and his FEPC proposals. Thomas
R. Waring, editor of the <cite>News and Courier</cite> and not to be confused
with his cousin the judge, said the opposition to President Truman’s
proposals was based on the belief that they “would be an invasion of
states and individual rights” and would result in “an intermingling
of races in hotels, restaurants, theaters, buses, and places of employment.”
Governor Thurmond termed the FEPC proposals the closest
this country had yet come to communism. They would turn the
United States into “nothing more than a police state,” he warned.
The proposals would force employers “to hire even Hindus.” The
Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, a few hours after addressing the
state legislature where he was warmly received, told a Klan rally that
if the civil rights proposals passed, it would “be legal for a Negro to
come up on your porch and ask for your daughter’s hand in marriage.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Particularly dismaying to the state’s political leaders has been the
growing realization that neither of the national political parties can
be relied upon to protect what South Carolina Democrats consider
to be the best interests of the state and the South. At the 1936 Democratic
National Convention the South lost an effective weapon when
the party abolished the ⅔ rule for party nominations. Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
President Roosevelt had been able to hold the state party leaders in
line, major revolts have developed in South Carolina against the national
Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1944.
Shortly before the 1952 presidential campaign was underway James
F. Byrnes declared that the South had become a “stepchild” in national
politics while both national parties were becoming slaves to the demands
of minorities which held the balance of power in key Northern
cities. He labeled the 1948 Democratic platform “more socialistic
than democratic,” and the result of pressures brought by “organized
minorities of northern states” on the leaders of the Democratic Party.
These pressures had forced those leaders “to abandon the cardinal
principle of states rights.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>This alleged “renunciation by the Democratic Party of the principles
upon which the Republic was founded” led in 1948 to the most
successful of the political revolts, if measured in terms of election results.
In the presidential election of that year the “Dixiecrat” movement,
with Governor Thurmond as its candidate, carried four Southern
states. Though this movement was generally justified in terms of
states rights and constitutional government, the race issue undoubtedly
was of paramount importance in inspiring it.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Thurmond publicly
and piously objected to the “white supremacy” theme of many of his
followers. He professed to be “not interested one whit in the question
of white supremacy” and referred to himself as “a progressive
Southerner” who was interested in bettering the conditions of the
Negro. He said he would conduct his campaign solely in support of
“the sovereignty of the states as against federal government interference.”
In October he reiterated that he was not running “on a platform
of racial discrimination.” That was “for each state to decide.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Despite such pronouncements the race question ran prominently
throughout Thurmond’s campaign speeches. Few did not contain a
long attack on President Truman’s various civil rights proposals,
especially FEPC. In August he said that if the “segregation program”
of President Truman were enforced, “the results in civil strife”
might be “horrible beyond imagination.” Lawlessness would be rampant.
Chaos would prevail. Streets would be unsafe. The President’s
“so called civil rights program” was written by Joseph Stalin
in 1920. It was “made to order for Communist use in their designs
upon national security.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>In the 1952 election widespread support developed for General Eisenhower
in the state because it was believed generally that the Republican
Party and its candidate were more in harmony with Southern
conservatism and consequently represented less of a “threat” to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
South on racial and economic issues.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> However, slightly more than a
majority of the state’s voters remained loyal to the national Democratic
Party; Negroes voted overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate.</p>

<h4><abbr title="Four"><span class="allsmcap">IV</span></abbr></h4>

<p>The constitution of 1868 authorized the first public school system
of South Carolina. Many years passed, however, before the state
had a functioning public school system worthy of the name, even for
the whites. Funds allocated by the state for public education increased
slowly. Though largely spent on white schools such outlays
brought limited advancement to Negro education through the trickle
down process. Discrepancies between the white and Negro systems
continued to grow. Not until the end of the nineteenth century did
the total amount spent on Negro education surpass that spent in 1879-80,
despite increasing enrollments. Not until 1919-20 did per capita
expenditures on Negro schools exceed those of the Hampton administration.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>In 1921 Professor Simkins, after making an unverified assertion to
the effect that “the educational separation of races in South Carolina
at present meets the approval of both races,” admitted that the disproportionate
share of the school funds spent for education of the
whites displeased the Negro. At this time the white schools received
$11.97 per capita while the Negro pupil received only $1.23.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Until the late 1940’s when the NAACP began bringing suits for
equal and/or integrated public schools, little support was given in the
state for providing public education for Negroes, a situation reflected
in the wide discrepancies in the funds spent for white and Negro schools.
This attitude, in its most extreme form, was expressed in the inaugural
address of Governor Cole Blease in 1911. Blease, a blatant Dixie
demagogue, recommended “liberal appropriations for all our state
institutions of learning for white boys and girls.” He also favored
the improvement of “the free school system so that every white child
in South Carolina” could be given “a good common school education.”
As for Negro education, the Governor declared that “when the people
of this country began to try to educate the Negro they made a serious
and grave mistake,” the worst results of which were yet to come. “So
why continue?” he asked.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>In 1941 Governor Maybank, reputedly more enlightened, appointed
a committee to study the state’s education system. It found, among
other things, that nineteen counties in the state had no high school
for Negroes and that there were 1644 school buses for whites and eight
for Negroes.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>The relative status of white-Negro education in South Carolina
can be illustrated, and better yet dramatized, by reference to a few
statistics for the years 1940 and 1952. In 1940 statistics reflected
the relative unconcern for quality Negro education. On the other
hand, the 1952 figures indicated the progress that had been made by
the time the Clarendon County school case was making its way through
the courts. The NAACP used these statistics with devastating effect
in developing its argument against separate-but-equal systems.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Since 1952 substantial improvements have come in both white and
Negro schools. Schools for Negroes have been rapidly approaching
at least a statistical equality with those of the whites.</p>

<p>Other statistics bear investigation in connection with the state’s
public education program. In 1950 the per capita income of South
Carolinians was $844, 46th in the nation. In the same year the state
spent 3.3 percent of its total personal income on public schools, tenth
highest percentage-wise in the country. In 1952, 42.7 percent of the
pupils attending public schools in the state were Negroes, a somewhat
higher percentage than Negroes in the total population. Between
1940 and 1950 the white population of the state increased 19.3 percent
while the Negro population increased only 1.0 percent. Yet during
the period 1940-52 the Negro school population increased 12.5 percent
compared to a white pupil increase of 9.9 percent.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>As late as 1918 only one public Negro high school was operating
in the state! Not until 1930 did South Carolina have an accredited
Negro high school. By 1950 there were 80 state accredited Negro
high schools, only ten of which, however, were recognized by the
Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. By comparison
there were 301 state accredited white high schools, 56 of which
met the accrediting standards of the Southern Association.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The same inequality evidenced on the public school level existed in
higher education. The state maintains five institutions of higher
learning for whites and one for Negroes. The Negro institution was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
originally rather thoroughly named the Colored Normal, Industrial,
Agricultural, and Mechanical College. The total state appropriation
for the white colleges in 1949 was in excess of $4,500,000 while that
for the Negro college was less than $600,000. Dr. Lewis K. McMillan,
former professor of history at the Negro institution, described the
college as “a glorified high school” treated as a “step child” by the
state. Until after World War <abbr title="Two">II</abbr> the college did not have a nominal
graduate or law school. However, in the light of a spate of federal
court decisions admitting Negro students to white state universities
when equal educational opportunities were lacking in state-supported
Negro schools, the 1945 state appropriations act authorized the college
to establish “graduate, Law, and Medical departments and such other
departments as may be necessary to provide training in all lines of
college activities for students attending this college.” No money was
appropriated until 1946 and then a completely inadequate $25,000 for
the graduate school. In 1947 $60,000 was appropriated for the Law
School. “Medical and pharmaceutical training” was authorized to
the extent of a paltry appropriation of $15,000 in 1950.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>While federal court cases in other states provided a general impetus
to this program, the danger that a Negro might be admitted to the
University of South Carolina loomed ominously on the horizon in 1946
when a Negro, Cleveland M. McQueen, applied for admission as a
graduate student in the School of Education. The state answered
his request with the appropriation for a graduate school at the Negro
college.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In the same year another Negro, John Wrighten, applied
for admission to the University Law School and was denied admittance.
He then took his case to the courts which ruled that unless the state
provided a law school at the Negro college “on a substantial parity
with the University Law School” by September, 1947, Wrighten had
to be admitted to the latter. By the deadline a law school had been
established and Wrighten made no further appeal.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Until January,
1958, no Negro made a concerted effort to gain admission to one of
the white institutions of higher education. Two Negroes applied for
admission to Clemson College in 1956 but did not press their applications
after being refused. But in January, 1958, as will be seen in
Chapter <abbr title="Seven">VII</abbr>, Negro students were clearing the decks for a law suit
to force admission to the University of South Carolina.</p>

<p>Culmination of the effort of the Negroes of South Carolina to win
legal recognition of their rights to first class citizenship came in 1954
in the Clarendon County school case. This was the key case in the
NAACP’s nationwide campaign to break down racial segregation in
public schools. Negro leaders purposely singled out Clarendon County
because it presented racially segregated schools in the worst possible
light. Located in the state’s black belt, the county in 1951 had approximately
23,000 Negroes and 8,000 whites. Enrolled in its public
schools were 6,531 Negro students as compared to 2,375 whites. Yet
school expenditures totaled $395,329 for whites as against $282,950
for Negroes.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In School District No. 22 (Summerton), the district
directly involved in the suit, there were 298 white pupils and 2,259
Negro pupils.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In facilities such as libraries, lighting fixtures, desks,
play grounds, classroom space, lavatories, lunchrooms, auditoriums
and teacher ratio to pupil, the Negro schools were decidedly inferior
to those provided for whites. For example, the NAACP pointed out
in the hearing of the case before the federal court that one of the
Negro schools with 600 pupils had only two toilets, both outdoors.
Another school lacked drinking faucets and water had to be brought
in a bucket from the home of a neighboring minister.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Clarendon case, technically known as Harry Briggs, Jr., <i>et al.</i>,
appellants, versus R. W. Elliott, <i>et al.</i>, appellees, had its origins in
1948 when a group of Negro citizens brought suit in federal court to
require state and county officials to provide school buses for Negro
pupils. Federal District Judge J. Waties Waring dismissed this suit
on the ground that the state as a governmental unit did not supply
school buses for any students. The following year Negro parents in
Clarendon petitioned authorities to bring Negro school facilities up
to the standards of the county’s white schools. The petition threatened
legal action if equality were not provided. In May, 1950, citing
failure of local officials to equalize school facilities, a suit was filed
asking that school authorities be compelled to provide equality. In
December, 1950, this suit was dropped and another, filed by forty
Negro parents, attacked segregation <i lang="la">per se</i> as a violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment and asked the abolition of all segregation in public
schools based on race.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The suit was filed under NAACP auspices.</p>

<p>In May, 1951, the case was heard by a special three-judge court
presided over by Federal Circuit Judge John J. Parker of North
Carolina and District Judges George Bell Timmerman, Sr., of Columbia
and J. Waties Waring of Charleston. The suit represented the first
all-out legal attack in the deep South on the system of racial segregation
on the public school level. It was clearly a test case; the ruling
would provide a basis for future court decisions in similar cases.
The appellants were represented by Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel
for the NAACP; the appellees by attorneys Robert McC. Figg of
Charleston and S. Emory Rogers of Summerton. Figg is an able
Charleston corporation lawyer; Rogers, a determined defender of
white supremacy at any price, was attorney for the Summerton
school board.</p>

<p>In the arguments before the court, Marshall sought to prove first
that the separate school facilities provided Negroes in District 22
were in fact physically unequal and second that segregation <i lang="la">per se</i>
was discriminatory and therefore a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Inasmuch as school officials readily admitted that the facilities
then offered Negroes in Clarendon were unequal, Marshall
concentrated on sociological and psychological arguments to support
his second contention. He argued that segregation invariably
resulted in the development of “psychological roadblocks” which prevented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Negro pupils from achieving “full absorption” of the educational
process.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>To buttress this position, Marshall introduced what the late Walter
White, then executive secretary of the NAACP, thought “the most
impressive array of authorities ever assembled to testify as experts
on the unreasonableness of segregation.” Their arguments, he said,
were “irrefutable.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The “experts” were half a dozen social scientists
from such universities as Harvard, Columbia, Vassar and
Howard. They held that segregation resulted in “discordant” education
that caused “moral confusion” for both whites and Negroes.
Amongst Negroes it resulted in “a lowering of self-esteem, a strengthening
of resentment and hostility” and a personality development
that emphasized “a desire to escape or withdraw from social participation.”
Amongst white children segregation developed a feeling of
guilt caused by their being taught simultaneously both the doctrine
of brotherly love and the practice of unbrotherly racial segregation.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Segregation was said to be building into the Negro “the very characteristics”
which were then used to justify prejudice.</p>

<p>The counter case presented by Clarendon school officials contained
three basic points. First, they maintained that segregation <i lang="la">per se</i>
was not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment as it had been recognized
as legal by the courts, Congress and the governments of seventeen
states. The only condition that could be legally demanded was
that the segregated facilities be substantially equal. Attorney Figg
readily admitted that school facilities then being offered Negroes
in the county were unequal but asked that the court allow the state
a “reasonable” time in which to equalize them. South Carolina, he
pointed out, was in the midst of a statewide equalization program.
The second argument held that school segregation statutes were “a
valid exercise of legislative power,” a matter of state legislative
policy rather than of constitutional right. No legal compulsion could
oblige a state to accept “scientific opinion” that its school program
“must be geared to personality development.” The third contention
of appellees was that to disturb drastically the racial <i lang="la">status quo</i> in
the deep South would produce “dangerous tensions and unrest.”
Racially segregated school facilities, Figg insisted, were the “normal”
result of a racial conflict heritage in the state of South Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The court ruled two to one against the appellants. Judges Parker
and Timmerman held that segregation <i lang="la">per se</i> was not a violation of
the Fourteenth Amendment. They said, however, that “the educational
facilities and opportunities” provided both races “must be
equal.” Equality had to be provided “promptly” and “in good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
faith.” Consequently school officials were directed to report to the
court after six months as to what actions were being taken to provide
equality. In rejecting Marshall’s line of argumentation the
court asserted that judges had “no more right to read their ideas of
sociology into the Constitution than their ideas of economics.”</p>

<p>Judge Waring dissented vigorously. The majority opinion, he
wrote, was “unreasonable, unscientific, and based on unadulterated
prejudice.” He condemned the “sadistic insistence of the ‘white supremacists’
in declaring that their will must be imposed irrespective of
rights of other citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Governor James F. Byrnes hailed the majority ruling upholding
school segregation as “unanswerable.” The court’s “well-reasoned
opinion,” he maintained, completely vindicated the separate-but-equal
doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<h4><abbr title="Two"><span class="allsmcap">II</span></abbr></h4>

<p>Only slowly had white South Carolina awakened to the threat to
legal school segregation contained in the repeated petitions and suits
of Clarendon Negroes. By the time the state legislature convened in
January, 1951, the menace was fully realized. A definite fear had developed
that the courts might rule in favor of the Negro petitioners.
Basis for this fear was a long line of recent United States Supreme
Court rulings outlawing segregation in state university graduate and
professional schools even when facilities provided Negroes were in
fact substantially equal to those for whites. The legislators and
other state officials clearly recognized that by no criteria were white
and Negro schools even remotely equal, not only in Clarendon but
over the entire state. White South Carolina’s only hope, they reasoned,
lay in an immediate and far reaching program to provide
equal facilities for each race. At the same time certain precautionary
measures had to be taken against the possibility that the courts might
hold segregation <i lang="la">per se</i> illegal.</p>

<p>Leadership in this program fell to Governor James F. Byrnes, who,
after a long career in the federal government, including a short period
of service on the Supreme Court, had broken with President Truman
and the national Democratic Party and had returned to South Carolina
to vent his frustration against the national government and the
Democratic Party. Elected governor in 1950, he was inaugurated in
January, 1951. Almost immediately Byrnes began a long range
program which was to provide a basis for the state’s defense of the
racial <i lang="la">status quo</i> and the doctrine of separate-but-equal schools. The
program subsequently was enacted by the 1951 state legislature. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
position of Byrnes, as well as that of many of the state’s other leaders,
was summarized in a series of the governor’s speeches in early 1951.
South Carolina, he announced, would not then “nor for some years
to come mix white and colored children” in public schools. To prevent
this situation the state would, if necessary, “reluctantly” abandon
its public school system. “A lawful way” would be found to educate
all children “and at the same time provide separate schools for the
races.” While conceding the inferiority of Negro schools, Byrnes
insisted that the educational crisis facing the state was caused by
“the politicians in Washington and the Negro agitators in South
Carolina” seeking to alter the “Southern way of life.” But they
would find that “what a Carpetbag government could not do in the
Reconstruction period” was likewise impossible in 1951. The governor
would protect the “innocent Colored children,” the victims of
those elements which sought to end segregation. With a prescience
characteristic of white spokesmen for racial separation, he insisted
that “the overwhelming majority of colored people in this state” did
not want integrated schools. Byrnes denied that new school policies
were based on the expediency of necessity rather than on high principle.
He righteously observed shortly after the district court ruling
that “had there been no suit ... I would have urged this school program
to help the white and colored children” of the state.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The most important undertaking in the Byrnes educational approach
was the beginning of a tremendous school construction program.
The cost was estimated at $75,000,000 though the amount actually
spent on the project by 1957 was more than double the original figure.
To finance new school construction, Byrnes secured legislative passage
of a three percent sales tax.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> This program, in which more than
half the funds were spent for Negro schools, had the result of giving
the Negroes better physical school facilities in some localities than
those of the whites.</p>

<p>In addition to these constructive measures, the state legislature,
upon Byrnes’s recommendation, enacted several “preparedness measures”
for use in the event the federal courts outlawed segregation.
Local school officials were given authority to sell or lease school
property. Churches or other private groups thus would be enabled
to maintain schools under some sort of private school plan. Another
strategem provided that pupils could be transferred from one school
to another only with the approval of the superintendents of both
schools affected.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>A measure that caused understandable hesitation on the part of
many public officials and civic groups was the repeal of the constitutional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
provision requiring a state supported public school system.
The NAACP and other Negro groups vigorously opposed repeal, but
in February, 1952, the legislature approved a referendum on the proposal.
In the referendum, held the following November, 68 percent
of those voting favored repeal. Opponents of the measure considered
the 32 percent against repeal something of a moral victory for their
side.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>To coordinate state policy on the segregation issue, the legislature
created a special 15-member committee. This group came to be
known as the Gressette Committee, after its chairman, State Senator
L. Marion Gressette, a fifty-three year old Phi Beta Kappa, farmer-lawyer
from the low country Calhoun County. The committee had
a double function. First, it was directed to study the conditions
that would confront the state should the federal courts direct an end
to segregation in public schools. Second, it was to recommend to the
legislature a course of action which would “alleviate the serious condition
which would result” from such an eventuality.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> This committee,
after assisting Byrnes in developing his program in 1951, was
inactive from that time until the Supreme Court ruling of May 17,
1954.</p>

<h4><abbr title="Three"><span class="allsmcap">III</span></abbr></h4>

<p>Following the circuit court’s ruling the Clarendon case was immediately
appealed to the United States Supreme Court. By the time
the highest tribunal considered the case, the six months period allowed
by the circuit court for school officials to furnish <i lang="la">bona fide</i> equality
for Negroes had elapsed. Consequently, on January 26, 1952, the
case was remanded to the circuit court which was directed to take
whatever action it deemed appropriate in view of its findings. In
the meanwhile Judge Waring had retired and had been replaced on
the court by Judge Armisted M. Dobie of Virginia. At the rehearing
counsel for the school officials reported on the steps taken by
the county and on other plans contemplated under the statewide
school equalization program. These plans, when completed, would
provide equality in all areas for white and Negro schools, claimed
school authorities. Though equality admittedly as yet had not been
attained, such would be forthcoming within a “reasonable” time.
Accepting these arguments at face value, the circuit court ruled unanimously
that “the defendants have complied with the decree of the
court to equalize facilities as soon as humanly possible and no good
could be accomplished for anyone” by ordering an end to segregation.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
The NAACP again immediately appealed to the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Arguments before the Supreme Court took place in December,
1952, in conjunction with four similar cases. Clarendon County was
represented by John W. Davis, noted constitutional lawyer and Democratic
presidential candidate in 1924. Davis, a twentieth century
“Northern man with Southern principles,” based his case mainly on
grounds of constitutionalism and states rights. “What is the great
national policy underlying this whole question?” he asked. “Is it not
that the very strength and fiber of our federal system is local self-government
in those matters for which local action is competent?”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Again the appellees stressed three main points. They maintained
that the state was proceeding to remove “all inequalities between its
white and colored schools,” as had been found by the lower court.
Further, school authorities argued that the legality of school segregation
had been exercised and recognized so continuously that the question
was “no longer open for debate.” As for the testimony of
“sundry academic persons” offered in opposition to segregation, such
“opinions” presented questions of legislative policy only and formed
no sufficient basis for any conclusions on the subject, least of all for
a judicial finding.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for appellants, presented the
same arguments he had used in the lower courts.</p>

<p>Unable to arrive at a decision on the basis of arguments advanced
at the first hearing, the Supreme Court in June, 1953, asked for further
pleadings on five questions. These involved essentially two points:
(1) In the light of the history of the Fourteenth Amendment, was
school segregation <i lang="la">per se</i> violative of that amendment? (2) Assuming
that segregation was unconstitutional, would it necessarily follow
that schools should be integrated “forthwith” or could the Court in
the exercise of its equity powers remit the cases to lower courts and
permit a “gradual adjustment” to integration?</p>

<p>Answers to these questions were prepared under the supervision of
T. C. Callison, South Carolina’s Attorney General. The state maintained
that the “overwhelming preponderance of the evidence” demonstrated
that the Fourteenth Amendment could not be construed as
forbidding racial segregation. In reply to the second query, the
state held that on the assumption stated, the Court could permit
gradual integration to be carried out within broad policy limitations
by the lower federal courts. However, in this connection, the state
argued that even assuming that the courts could declare segregated
schools unconstitutional, it was not within the judicial power to determine
what, if any, non-segregated system should be substituted in
their place.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
<abbr title="Four"><span class="allsmcap">IV</span></abbr></p>

<p>Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the Court’s unanimous opinion,
a milestone in the American Negro’s struggle for human dignity and
freedom.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> After reviewing the background of the various cases under
consideration, the Court declared that the history of the Fourteenth
Amendment, as it applied to school segregation, was “inconclusive.”
Furthermore, said the Chief Justice, the school segregation issue had
never been definitely settled by the Supreme Court. Recent decisions
concerning inequality on graduate and professional levels of schooling
had not faced the basic issue—the legal status of segregation <i lang="la">per se</i>.
Consequently the Court would attempt conclusively to settle the
problem.</p>

<p>In premising its decision, the Court turned not to “tangible factors”
but to the overall “effect of segregation on education.” On this basis
it asked: “Does segregation of children in public schools solely on
the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other ‘tangible’
factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority
group of equal educational opportunities?” The reply was direct:
“We believe that it does.” Accepting the testimony presented in
the lower court by the social scientists, the Court found that segregation
of Negro children “from others of similar age and qualifications
solely because of their race” generated feelings of inferiority
concerning their status in the community that might affect “their
hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.” In the light
of such a condition the Court concluded that “in the field of public
education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate
educational facilities are inherently unequal.”</p>

<p>The cases were not immediately disposed of since no implementing
decree was included in this ruling. Recognizing the revolutionary
nature of the transition being ordered, the Court, departing from
established legal tradition, restored the cases to the docket and asked
all affected states, the NAACP and the United States Attorney
General to appear as friends of the Court and present further argument
on how best to implement the decision. The state of South
Carolina refused to come before the Court in this capacity. Attorney
General Callison thought that such an appearance might indicate
that the state was bringing itself “within the jurisdiction of
the Court in this particular case.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The state, as such, would do
nothing that might make the Court’s decision specifically applicable
to all school districts. Clarendon officials, however, did file a brief
with the Court. They urged that the case be remanded to the lower
federal court to permit school authorities “the opportunity of presenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
their problems fully to that tribunal and of appealing to its
equitable discretion in connection with their further handling of its
affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Attorney Figg asked the Court to give the Clarendon
authorities time to allow for “community acceptance.” But privately
the less suave Attorney Rogers maintained that there was
going to be no integration in South Carolina.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court’s implementing decree was not issued until
May 31, 1955, a little over a year after its momentous decision.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It
recognized the existence of “varied local school problems.” Consequently
federal district courts were given the responsibility within
their local areas for supervising the compliance with the Court’s
original decision. While giving attention to local conditions, the
district courts were to require school officials to make “a prompt
and reasonable start toward compliance” with the original ruling.
Delays in beginning integration were justifiable only when “necessary
in the public interest” and “consistent with good faith compliance.”
In proceeding “with all deliberate speed,” school officials
were to be allowed consideration for such factors as “physical condition
of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel,
revision of school districts ... and a revision of local laws
and regulations” requiring segregation. This decision was applicable
in the strict sense only to those school districts immediately involved
in the litigation. No allowance was made for applying its
provisions to other school districts. Segregation therefore would be
erased only when action voluntarily was taken by school authorities
or when directed by federal courts following petition by aggrieved
groups upon failure of local officials to follow the spirit of the decision.</p>

<p>On July 15, 1955, the Federal Circuit Court, composed of Judges
Parker, Timmerman and Dobie, met in Columbia and disposed of
the Clarendon case in conformity with the Supreme Court ruling. In
an unanimous decision the three judges restrained Summerton school
officials “from refusing on account of race to admit to any school
under their supervision any child qualified to enter such school, from
and after such time as they may have made the necessary arrangements
for admission of children to such schools on a non-discriminatory
basis with all deliberate speed.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>There the case rested in the spring of 1958. The school officials
have not yet “made the necessary arrangements” to end segregation,
and Negro parents, fearing among other things that the public
schools will be closed if precipitate action is taken, have not pushed
the matter further.</p>

<h3>THE EMERGENCE OF PATTERNS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent10 unindent">So strongly drawn is the line between the two races ...
and so strengthened by the form of habit and education,
that ... no power on earth can overcome the difficulty.—<cite>John

<p>The May 17, 1954, decision of the Supreme Court in the school
segregation cases issued in a new era in race relations in the South.
From this point onward the race issue centered on public school integration.
Reaction to the ruling tended to vary in proportion to the
percentage of Negroes in the local population. Some border areas
began preparations for compliance; the deep South was defiant.
South Carolina, with a high percentage of Negro population (between
35 and 40 percent) and with a strong master-servant tradition governing
its race relations, was among the most intransigent of the deep
South states. Few white South Carolinians were willing even to
consider compliance with the decision as being among the possible
solutions to the segregation problem.</p>

<p>The Clarendon verdict momentarily stunned the white citizenry
of South Carolina. Though politicians and their allies in the “power
structure” of the state quickly warmed to their traditional thespian
role of championing white supremacy and competed in lambasting
the Court and the decision, the general public was slow in grasping
its full implications. It was this seeming state of indecision that misled
those moderates who were willing to go ahead and at least try
school integration. The majesty of a Supreme Court decision lent
conviction that little needed to be done and in any event there was
no sense in antagonizing one’s neighbors. As a consequence the
moderates rested on their oars and did virtually nothing to help prepare
the way for the implementation of the Court’s ruling. This
was a tragic error. But in retrospect and admittedly with the benefit
of historical hindsight, it was no more an error than the Court’s
allowing the Clarendon County officials an unspecified length of time
to achieve integration. Had the Court ordered immediate integration,
compliance might well have been forthcoming since at the time
there was no alternative course of action. As was, the Court allowed
the Clarendon officials time to develop stalling tactics and the state
to adopt a public policy which together have been successful in preventing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
even one Negro child from entering a white public school in
South Carolina.</p>

<p>Official reaction to the decision was universally condemnatory.
Governor James F. Byrnes was “shocked” to learn that the Court
had overthrown the Plessy doctrine. The late Senator Burnet R.
Maybank labeled the ruling “a shameful political edict rather than a
judicial decision.” The Court made the ruling, he asserted, only
“under the duress” of Chief Justice Earl Warren and Attorney General
Herbert Brownell. Had the Democrats been in power, the decision
would never have been made. Senator Olin D. Johnston, too, saw
the fine Venetian hands of Warren and Brownell in the decision
which he described as “a flagrant, direct appeal for the political favor
of minority groups.” He deplored the Court’s “radical departure
from the well-reasoned” separate-but-equal doctrine as being written
largely by “subversive groups.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Senator J. Strom Thurmond was, if anything, even more critical.
Blaming the decision on “pressure and power politics,” he termed it
“one of the worst ever handed down by any court ... in this country.”
Most of the authorities cited by the Court, he said, “were either members
of Communist-front organizations” or their loyalty was “in
serious question.” Broadening his attack, Thurmond declared that
integration was “impractical, illogical, and unconstitutional” and undesired
by white people or “good Negro people” of the South. The
trouble came from “outside agitators” who were stirring up Negroes
with discrimination charges.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Similarly, Attorney General T. C. Callison saw “no constitutional
authority, no statutory authority, no judicial precedent, no reason
and no justice in that decision.” Callison, a small town lawyer,
described Gunnar Myrdal, “the principal authority” used by the
Court, as “a foreign Socialist, with no first hand knowledge of conditions
in the South.” Many of Myrdal’s “collaborators” in the
writing of <cite>An American Dilemma</cite> were allegedly “members of Communist
front organizations.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>In sharp contrast to the comments of the state’s leading political
figures was the reaction of James M. Hinton, state NAACP president.
Hinton believed that there was “no place in a democracy, and certainly
not in the Christian church, for segregation.” Both whites
and Negroes of South Carolina, he thought, would accept “any decision
from the U. S. Supreme Court.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The press was no less critical than the politicians. The Charleston
<cite>News and Courier</cite> was especially outspoken. This paper attacked
the decision on several grounds. It gave new meaning to the Constitution;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
“drove another nail into the coffin of states rights;” consisted
of a “sociological finding, as contrasted with an affirmation of the
law;” constituted an abridgement of “the freedom of white people;”
repealed and outlawed laws and customs that were “older than the
Republic;” and was the result of packing the Supreme Court “to
represent the New-Fair Deal viewpoint” to the exclusion of the
“States Rights viewpoint.” Noting the embarrassingly favorable
reaction to the decision throughout the non-Southern part of the
country and the world, the <cite>News and Courier</cite> asserted that the only
ones “unhappy” with the ruling were “white Southerners ... and the
rank and file of self-respecting Negroes,” who were “not interested in
being compelled to associate with one another.” While Editor Thomas
R. Waring’s paper urged “wisdom and tolerance,” it opposed “cowardice”
on the part of Southerners.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The Columbia <cite>Record</cite> was more realistic. Southerners should not
have been surprised by the Supreme Court’s “bouleversement on segregation,”
said Editor Buchanan, because such a decision was the logical
result of previous cases affecting graduate and professional levels
of education. It was based “not upon law but upon sociology and
psychology, so-called social sciences which true scientists agree today
are not scientific.” The opinion was “a sociological interpretation of
the Constitution” and segregation was “sociologically, not legally ...
unconstitutional, null and void.” The Court was guilty of getting
“too far ahead too fast of public opinion in the South.” The Justices
might have held that segregation <i lang="la">per se</i> was inequality, suggested the
<cite>Record</cite>, but then concluded that because of “the cultural, health, and
other differences between children of the two races and in the preponderance
of Negroes in its school population” the Clarendon district
had problems which would make integration “harmful, psychologically
and sociologically.” The capital city paper, a strong supporter of
President Eisenhower, took issue with those who blamed or credited
the decision on the Republican administration. Buchanan insisted
that the decision was a Democratic ruling eight to one, since Eisenhower
had appointed only one justice to the Court. In seeking to
absolve Chief Justice Warren of responsibility, the <cite>Record</cite> declared
with a good deal of truth that there were “some indications” that the
case had been decided before Warren’s appointment.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The editor of
the <cite>Record</cite> refused to concede that what was involved was an “American”
decision rather than either a Republican or a Democratic one.</p>

<p>The Anderson <cite>Independent</cite> likewise stressed the non-legal nature of
the Court’s action. Taking exactly the opposite direction from the
<cite>Record</cite>, the upcountry paper said that the decision, which combined “a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
bit of law along with large doses of psychology and sociology,” was not
unexpected in view of the pro-integration policies of the Republican
administration. It conveniently ignored the attitude of the national
Democratic Party toward the segregation issue. Decision or no decision,
said the <cite>Independent</cite>, the races would “not be mixed in South
Carolina schools today, tomorrow, next year or in the years to come.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Only the Florence <cite>Morning News</cite> admitted the end of school segregation
in South Carolina a probability. On the day following the decision,
Editor Jack H. O’Dowd announced, prematurely to be sure,
that “segregation is ended in Southern schools.” He then added, “It
can be assumed that South Carolina, in the immediate future, is to
have integrated schools, or no public schools.... The question is no
longer whether or not segregation is proper, the present question is
what the state is to do in the face of the Court’s decision.” Within a
year, however, the Florence editor saw the South Carolina light, or
felt the intolerably hot breath of the white population on his neck, and
became more critical of the decision. In April, 1955, he chastised the
Court for having “swapped law and legal tradition for ... warped ideas
of sociology” which only endangered the “medium through which the
Negro has made his greatest gains—public education.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>White South Carolinians generally were no less antagonistic toward
the decision than their political leaders and newspapers. W. D.
Workman, Jr., the <cite>News and Courier</cite> correspondent in Columbia,
thought the Court was more concerned with the Southern Negro than
his white neighbor. And this in spite of the fact that the latter had
always relied upon the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution
“rather than upon the changing social and political standards of a
polyglot nation.” Southerners, boasted this young apostle of the old
order, “have been and still are, closer by blood, by belief, and by
behavior to the framers of those two documents than are persons of
any other section of the country.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> L. B. McCord, the Clarendon
County school superintendent and former Presbyterian minister,
thought the decision “one of the worst things that has happened in
this century,” endangering as it did “<em>the splendid relation</em>” which
had previously existed between the races “in this good old Southland.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Stanley F. Morse, president of the Charleston Grass Roots League,
a white supremacy organization, viewed the decision as “just another
successful step in the Red Revolution against the United States,”
marking “the attainment of one of the objectives of the Communist
drive among U. S. Negroes started in 1920.” The fact that the decision
was unanimous was “indicative of powerful pressure on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
Court by ‘liberal’ politicians and Marxian Socialist conspirators.” In
a similar manner another Charleston man, Huger Sinkler, attorney
and former state legislator, considered the decision to be “but another
aftermath to Appomattox.” He believed that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... the authors of this latest outrage are as deeply imbued with hatred
for our Southern customs as was Thaddeus Stevens. And, unfortunately, in both
periods, we find as President a man whose decisions are obviously made for him
by others.</p>

<p>In the case of Grant, it was the man with the mulatto mistress, Thaddeus
Stevens, and the small corps of abolitionists. In the instance of Eisenhower, it
would appear to be Dewey, Brownell and Dulles, men whose political ambitions
lead them to pose as friends of the underprivileged, and, in the case of Dewey,
a man with an open hatred for the South....</p>

<p>Reconstruction days were harsh, but, notwithstanding the scalawags, the
carpetbaggers and the federal bayonet, the basic principles for which the South
fought were not destroyed.</p>

<p>Today, we face a similar challenge. Perhaps, if we have the strength of character,
exhibited by the generation preceding, the dawn of a new 1876 will arrive.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The reaction of the white people of Clarendon County to the decision,
according to <cite>Record</cite> reporter Carlton Truax, a former missionary,
ranged from “resignation to bitterness and violent rebellion.”
A minority “fringe group” openly expressed the opinion that blood
would flow if Negroes sought admission in white Clarendon schools.
Truax found “much bitterness, some deep frustration and often a
sense of helplessness.” At a meeting held in June, 1955, approximately
350 white residents of the Summerton school district agreed that the
schools should be kept open only until the courts ordered the admission
of a Negro pupil to the white school.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The white Clarendon
community had decided that segregation was more important than
education.</p>

<p>Reaction to the implementing decision of May 31, 1955, was less
critical than that of the earlier ruling. The Columbia <cite>Record</cite> considered
the Court’s plan to remand the cases to lower courts a partial
Southern victory even though the justices failed to change their original
decision. Similarly the Florence <cite>Morning News</cite> saw “some small
comfort” for the South in the Court’s failure to establish a deadline
for compliance. In a more critical mood, the Anderson <cite>Independent</cite>
declared that “the poison prescribed when the Supreme Court wrote
new law into the Constitution last year is no less deadly offered in
the small doses as now directed.” The Charleston <cite>News and Courier</cite>
believed that the Court’s “as soon as practicable” meant “never at
all.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Attorney General T. C. Callison, speaking for the state leaders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
termed the implementing decision “quite unsatisfactory.” He asserted
once again that integration in South Carolina would “bring
about every condition which will create a breeding bed for communism.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>An outgrowth of the Supreme Court’s invalidation of segregation
in the public schools was increased criticism of the Court itself. Extremists
expressed scorn for the Court as an instrument of government;
others urged the Court’s powers be curbed by Congress. Senator
Thurmond maintained that the members of the Court were “not
worthy to wear the robes of their high office.” James H. Hammond,
former state senator and direct lineal descendant of the ante-bellum
United States senator of “Cotton is King” fame, called the justices
“a bunch of skunks.” At a rally at Laurens, E. L. Edwards, the
Grand Dragon of the national Ku Klux Klan, referred to the “nine
buzzards on the Supreme Court.” State Representative George Harrell
of Florence County introduced into the state legislature a resolution
which urged Congress to investigate the Court for “attempting
to enact and enforce as law the sociological concepts of its members.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>According to the <cite>News and Courier</cite> the Court had become “an instrument
to uphold the right of Big Government to slap down state and
individual rights.” It was more concerned with “the rights of leftist
labor officials and Communist editors” than “the rights of white
Southerners.” And it had degenerated into a mere political arm of
the Eisenhower administration. Indirectly accusing the President
of court-packing in the appointment of John Marshall Harlan, the
<cite>News and Courier</cite> peevishly declared that “a suitable man could have
been found whose grandfather had not been the only dissenter to the
basic (Plessy-Ferguson) decision in the 1896 issue.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The need of
the country, said the <cite>Record</cite>, was “a Supreme Court in the pre-New
Deal tradition, one of integrity, stability, learning and judicial outlook.”
Unfortunately neither national party offered hope in this
area. Warren was “a political appointment” and on the Court he
had been a “political Chief Justice.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> No less critical of the Court,
the <cite>Independent</cite> suggested that the justices would be less subject
to “political pressures” and “radical departures” if they were appointed
not for life but for specified terms.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The Columbia <cite>State</cite>,
not to be undone, opined that the popularity of the Supreme Court
among “sound thinking people seems to resemble that of measles.”
It asserted on another occasion that the Court had rather “meander
through Myrdalism than precedents.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Congressman Robert J. Ashmore, a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, criticized the Court for a long line of “foolish, unconstitutional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and un-American” decisions. Sooner or later, he asserted,
Congress would realize that the real aim of the justices was “to set up
their socialistic ideas as supreme.” In like manner Representative
William Jennings Bryan Dorn accused the Court of degenerating
into a mere “rubber stamp” for the Eisenhower administration.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Former Justice James F. Byrnes spoke for states righters who
would curb the powers of the Court as a means of halting “creeping
centralism.” Holding the desegregation decision an amendment to
rather than an interpretation of the Constitution, Byrnes criticized
the Court for impairing “progress and ... freedom,” undoing the
South’s “steadily advancing racial amity,” and undermining the
Constitution. He blamed the decision on political factors and attempted
to discredit the sources cited in the Court’s opinion. The
one-time New Dealer quoted Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi
as authority for the statement that the files of the House Un-American
Activities Committee were “replete with citations and information”
concerning Theodore Brameld and E. Franklin Frazier, whose
studies were considered by the Court. Allegedly, the files contained
“18 citations of Frazier’s connections with Communist causes in the
United States.” Byrnes was especially critical of the use of Myrdal’s
<cite>An American Dilemma</cite>. He branded as obviously false Myrdal’s
statement that “in the South the Negro’s person and property are
practically subject to the whim of any white person who wishes to
take advantage of him or to punish him for any real or fancied
wrongdoing or insult.” Removed from the bench and no longer
the wearer of the judicial ermine, Byrnes stated flatly that the only
solution to such a situation was to limit the authority of the Court.
The trend toward centralization of government powers in Washington,
said the ex-War Mobilizer, was bringing “joy to the Communists and
their fellow travelers, for they could more easily influence one government”
than forty-eight.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Illustrative of the widespread opposition to the Court and its
anti-segregation decisions was a resolution signed by 52 prominent
white South Carolinians and circulated throughout the state for signature
by other Carolinians. All the original signers of this resolution
could be included in the State’s “power structure.” The more outstanding
included E. H. Agnew, Eugene S. Blease, Robert R. Coker,
Rev. Edward B. Guerry, R. Beverly Herbert, Col. Wyndham M.
Manning, Thomas H. Pope, Herbert Ravenel Sass, Ellison D. Smith,
Jr., Farley Smith, the Rt. Rev. Albert S. Thomas, Ransome J. Williams
and William D. Workman, Jr. These people, said the <cite>News and
Courier</cite>, “are not crackpots, extremists, Klansmen, rightists or leftists.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
They are largely middle-of-the-roaders. They are intelligent white
men. They are leaders in law, clergy, business, farming, education,
and politics of our state. In other words, they are a cross section of
the better-class moderate, white people of South Carolina.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The “Committee of 52” resolved that the Supreme Court relied
“not upon the body of established American law, but upon the dubious
conclusions of sociologists and psychologists whose number includes
persons tainted with Communism;” that pressure from the NAACP
and other “self-serving organizations” had “lowered the will of politicians
and the public generally to resist encroachments upon the
sovereign rights of states;” and that such pressure was endangering
both “the public school system of South Carolina and the harmonious
relationship between the white and Negro races.” Therefore, the resolution
urged the state legislature to take such steps as “may be necessary
or desirable to interpose the sovereignty of the State of South
Carolina between Federal courts and local school officials.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The
petitioners had some initial success and within a week 7,000 persons
had reportedly signed the resolution. However, this movement soon
lost its drive and produced no tangible results.</p>

<p>As already observed, one of the tactics most widely used by the
segregationists was ridicule and disparagement of the Court’s use of
sociological and psychological authority. W. D. Workman, Jr., some
fifty years behind the times, spoke of the “new school of sociological
jurisprudence.” If Negro children required the company of white
children “to fully develop personality and education,” he wrote, then
South Carolina needed help because in some areas there weren’t “enough
white folks to go around.” In a heavy handed attempt at facetiousness,
he suggested that the Supreme Court set up the number of white
and colored children necessary to form an acceptable classroom situation.
In like vein, the <cite>Record</cite> complained that “nobody knows what
the law is today or what it will be tomorrow with a Supreme Court
making its decisions on whim, fancy or pseudo sociology.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, which shudders at all innovations, was critical
of the Court’s emphasis on “psychiatry.” The injection of psychiatry
into the controversy brought a letter to the editor from Dr.
Norton Williams, a Charleston psychiatrist, who felt that the Supreme
Court had “used unwise judgment” and accepted “bad advice” from
the psychiatrists who testified in the Clarendon case. “False interpretations”
of psychiatry “in the hands of some psychiatrists with misguided
motivations” would lead to “unhappy situations” such as the
anti-segregation riots in Delaware and Tennessee. Many psychiatrists,
according to Williams, “using good, profound psychiatric principles,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
realized the need for maintaining segregation. The Negro, a
member of a culturally inferior race, was not yet ready for integration.
Until he had developed his own culture he would remain unready. To
force integration suddenly would make the Negro feel “inferior, hostile,
or defiantly competitive.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Only on the rarest of occasions did a white South Carolinian speak
out in favor of the decision of the Supreme Court. On one such
occasion H. B. Clark of Charleston, in a letter to the <cite>News and
Courier</cite>, criticized the white man’s “conception of the Negro as something
slightly subhuman, a sort of beast of burden for the exploitation
of the white man.” He declared that</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>All the restrictions upon economic and educational opportunity, all the degrading
Jim Crow laws which we impose upon the Negro say, in effect, “We no
longer own you as slaves, but we are determined to keep you in a subordinate
position in our society, and to impress upon you in a thousand small ways every
day that you are an inferior race.” Now the justices of the Supreme Court are
not black-hearted villains who have sold their souls to the devil of political
expediency; on the contrary, they are simply nine Americans honest enough to
face inescapable conflict between these undemocratic values of the South and
the principles of equality and freedom on which the Constitution is based, and
courageous enough to proclaim the necessity of eliminating this paradoxical state
of affairs no matter what the cost in terms of readjustment of traditional thinking.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<h4><abbr title="Two"><span class="allsmcap">II</span></abbr></h4>

<p>White South Carolinians, regarding integration with outright disdain
and horror, advance many arguments in defense of segregation.
These range from temporary expediency to the fear of “mongrelization”
and ultimate extinction of the white race. Running parallel
is the constant reiteration that segregation, which allegedly provides
separate-but-equal facilities, is of greater advantage to the Negro than
to the white. Such a view, to be sure, runs completely counter to
the assertion of President Truman’s committee on civil rights which
said in 1948 that segregation had become “the cornerstone of an
elaborate structure of discrimination.” Separate-but-equal arguments,
declared the committee, were the basis for “one of the outstanding
myths of American history;” while facilities were indeed
separate they were far from equal.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In defending segregation white
South Carolinians are far less concerned with the equal than with
the separate.</p>

<p>Arguments against racial integration indicate a frank belief in the
inherent superiority of the white race. In a widely read article in
<cite>Harper’s</cite> magazine, Thomas R. Waring argued against integration
on the following grounds: (1) The incidence of venereal diseases was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
higher among Negroes. (2) The cultural home environment of Negroes
was inferior. (3) Marital habits among many Southern Negroes
were “to state it mildly, casual.” (4) Crime was more prevalent
among Negroes. (5) The intellectual development of Negro school
children was generally below that of their white counterparts.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
The late Herbert Ravenel Sass, a well known Charleston author, got
down to Freudian bedrock in stating that fear of intermarriage was
the most important factor in Southern opposition to racial integration.
In an article in the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>, he asserted that “it is the deep
conviction of nearly all white Southerners in the states which have
large Negro populations, that the mingling or integration of white
and Negro children in the South’s primary schools would open the
gates to miscegenation and wide-spread racial amalgamation.” He
claimed that there was “almost no hatred of the Negro” nor was
there anything that could “accurately be called race prejudice” in
South Carolina. In a skillful display of semantic gymnastics, he
held the desire for segregation to be based on “race preference.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>In rebuttal to Sass, Harvard historian Oscar Handlin declared that
statistics indicated that the growth of equality between the races did
not increase the rate of intermarriage. Historically racial “miscegenation”
had been the “direct product of the inferiority of Negro women.”
The extent of “miscegenation” varied directly in proportion to the
degree of that inferiority. The idea that Negroes were eager to marry
whites, he said, was “a delusion born of the white’s own vanity and
of his ignorance of the real sentiments of his fellow Americans of
another color.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Answering criticisms such as those of Handlin the <cite>News and Courier</cite>
replied: “The separation of races in public schools, in the circumstances
that exist in South Carolina, is necessary. It is not evil or
immoral. It does not deprive Negroes of their rights. It does protect
the rights of white people. Arguments to the contrary usually
stem from ignorance. Firm decent resistance in the end will win.”
The paper branded integrationists as “Meddlesome Matties” who
were interfering with a custom “older than the Republic.” Only in
the last few years had “native born Americans ... learned from
the NAACP and the eggheads that a traditionally American practice
was un-American.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Record</cite> considered segregation a <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i> which enabled
the two races to live together until a more suitable solution could be
evolved. Such would result only from a long and slow process of
education in which racial prejudice would be wiped out.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The attitude of <cite>Morning News</cite> Editor O’Dowd was highly ambivalent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Four days before the Court’s original decision he had declared
that segregation traditionally had been “a social, economic
and political expedient” which had no “moral justification.” Yet
he believed the institution continued to be necessary. Three months
later he described segregation as “a benevolent and paternal social
order,” which “has not been a matter of expediency.” Under
O’Dowd’s successor, James A. Rogers, the <cite>Morning News</cite> moved
nearer the position of the <cite>Record</cite> and the <cite>News and Courier</cite>. In his
first editorial comment on the problem, Rogers stated his “sincere
belief” that segregation was practiced in the best interest of both
races. Under such circumstances segregation was “not an evil scheme
to keep the Negro in subjection but a high road” along which the
Negro could “achieve maximum development in an atmosphere without
tension or ill will.” A suitable solution to the problem of integration,
Rogers thought, would come only after “education, education,
education for a period of generations, and patience, the practice of
tolerance and the willingness to wait until the alchemy of good will
has done its work.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Such a proposal meant postponing integration
indefinitely.</p>

<p>Amongst individual white South Carolinians much the same attitudes
prevailed. Governor George Bell Timmerman, Jr., indignantly
contended that “any statement that our law is inherently unequal
is inherently untrue.” Lieutenant Governor Ernest F. Hollings, young,
handsome and ambitious, told the Lions Club of Florence that
he did not know anyone who believed in “any prejudice on account
of race.” Segregation was based on “history, culture and economic
background” rather than race prejudice. Former Governor Byrnes
told the Sumter Kiwanis Club that segregation arose not from “petty
prejudice” but from “an instinctive desire for the preservation of
our race.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Other South Carolinians expressed these sentiments in greater or
lesser degree. Charles D. Haigh of Florence pleaded with “white
American fathers” to guard their “defenseless children” against all
attempts at integration. Criticizing any moderate approach, he recognized
only two alternatives—“segregation or integration and eventual
mongrelization of the races.” Should the latter alternative come
to pass there would be “no ‘Star Spangled Banner’ as a national
anthem, but more than likely some such song as, ‘Rest your li’l kinky
head upon my breast, w’suns is all alike.’”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Similarly, Gilbert Wilkes
of the Charleston suburb of Mt. Pleasant had not taught his children
“any prejudices against other races” except insofar as “racial purity”
was concerned. In keeping his children free from prejudice he imparted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to them “the knowledge that God chose members of the white
race as his chosen people and then colored the others.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<h4><abbr title="Three"><span class="allsmcap">III</span></abbr></h4>

<p>The course of race relations in the state during the period following
the court decision was indicative of the moves and counter moves
by the proponents and opponents of integration. Segregationists were
unanimous in asserting that race relations had been harmonious in the
state in the days before the “agitation” began. Historically, said the
<cite>News and Courier</cite>, “whites and Negroes have got along with a minimum
of friction in the South.” Likewise, “the South was making rapid
progress toward elimination of racial prejudice,” claimed the <cite>Record</cite>.
“There was sympathy and understanding among whites for Negroes
in the South.” This era of good will allegedly had been overturned
by those who would force integration on an unwilling South. For
the “cold war” between the races, full responsibility rested with the
“titular Negro leadership.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>During the year between the original ruling and the implementation
decree there was little outward evidence that relations between
the races had changed appreciably. Each side appeared to be awaiting
final action by the Court before digging in and taking its stand.
Abruptly in the summer of 1955 the situation changed. The implementing
ruling came on the last day of May. Almost at once
there followed such “overt actions as the filing of NAACP-sponsored
integration petitions.” In response, the whites organized the Citizens
Councils which employed or threatened to employ the economic
boycott as a means of ending the attempts by Negroes to secure school
integration. The most notable example of the economic boycott in
action came in the city of Orangeburg in 1955-56. Orangeburg
Negroes retaliated in kind and relations between the races deteriorated
generally, remaining at their lowest between the summers of 1955
and 1956. The <cite>New York Times</cite>, in surveying race relations in
early 1956, noted this retrogradation. So did the <cite>News and Courier’s</cite>
W. D. Workman, Jr., who reported “a massive deterioration of the
racial amity which had been developing and increasing between
whites and Negroes.” “Distrust, suspicion and growing bitterness”
had supplanted good will. By the following December, when the
full implications of the boycott were felt and realized by both whites
and Negroes, Workman noted that relations between the races seemed
“considerably more tranquil” than a year earlier. He observed that
while neither side had compromised “its adamant position,” each was
attempting to soft-pedal the issue.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>A few whites, by indirection, conceded that the “mutual respect
and affection” which allegedly had traditionally characterized the
relations between the races in South Carolina resulted from the
Negro’s submission, in the face of overpowering odds, to a <i lang="la">modus
vivendi</i> dictated by the white man. Dr. E. E. Colvin, pastor of the
Immanuel Baptist Church of Orangeburg, thought segregation had
been a success even if the South “used to have an occasional lynching.
Almost invariably the Negro who was lynched had committed
some terrible crime.” By contrast, “up North where they don’t have
segregation they have a race riot every once in a while.” Similarly,
Dr. J. G. McMaster of Kingstree wrote that “whites have sometimes
taken advantage of colored but that can be expected and on the other
hand, Negroes are less honest with each other than are whites with
them.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<h4><abbr title="Four"><span class="allsmcap">IV</span></abbr></h4>

<p>Public spokesmen offer many answers to the school integration
question. The press of the state constantly urges “patience and forbearance;”
“calm, careful consideration, hard thinking and studied
action;” “calm, reasonable, and foresighted” actions; “cool calculation,
searching forethought;” “restraint and common sense;” “planning,
... determination, perhaps ... cunning;” and “calm and wise decisions.”</p>

<p>Of the many proposals for circumventing the Court’s decision, voluntary
segregation is the most popular. <cite>Morning News</cite> Editor Rogers
thought it represented the “ultimate answer to the problem.” The
<cite>News and Courier</cite> believed that “of all the approaches ... now uppermost
in the minds of South Carolinians, the voluntary selection of
schools by patrons according to their own race keeps recurring as the
most reasonable.” Former Governor Byrnes stated that “the hope” of
the South was voluntary segregation.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Proposals for voluntary segregation,
of course, contain no provision for Negro parents who desire
integrated schools for their children.</p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> has been a consistent advocate of voluntary
segregation. In defending this approach, the Charleston paper said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Happiness cannot be measured in worldly goods, nor social position, nor many
of the things that some of us hold too dear. Contentment is necessary for true
happiness....</p>

<p>Too many people of all races and stations in life seem dissatisfied with things
as they are. While ambition and the go-getter spirit are praiseworthy, whining
for “equal treatment”—which often means excuse for shortcomings—should not
be a part of a person’s equipment. Merit has a way of being recognized.</p>

<p>Too many people—both white and Negro—are trying to bite off more of life
than they can chew. Not everyone is qualified to take a place in the front rank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Instead of being angry, they would do themselves a favor by adopting a philosophical
attitude. Instead some persons dissatisfied with their own accomplishments
demand a change in government, in economic laws, in the rules of society.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquote-->

<p>Another solution is the migration of the Negroes to non-Southern
parts of the United States, thus relieving “the pressure of numbers”
on the black belt areas of the South. This proposal represents a
revival of the pre-Civil War suggestion that the free Negro should be
returned to Africa. But in 1955 even the <cite>News and Courier</cite> conceded
that “migration to Africa seems no longer feasible.” In a letter to
the editor of the paper W. W. Bragg of Columbia offered concrete proposals
to encourage migration. He urged that the state provide
each Negro desiring to migrate with a small sum of money—$100 to
$200—and pay his transportation expenses. The Negro would be required
to “go to a State in the North,” and agree not to return to South
Carolina for five years. In the long run this would be cheaper for the
state, argued Bragg, because the Negro paid much less money in taxes
than the value he received in state services.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The South Carolina Farm Bureau Federation and its president, E. H.
Agnew of Starr, also advanced proposals for the continuation of segregation.
Agnew, who strongly opposed “this dastardly thing of forced
integration,” summarized what he considered to be the views of farmers
in the state: “The farm people of South Carolina, both white and
colored, are bitterly opposed to such a program as the Supreme Court
outlines. They earnestly desire both separate schools and a continued
relationship of peace and harmony but they are determined that this
vile thing shall be circumvented. They want neither abolition of public
schools nor do they want a shotgun solution to the problem but if worst
must come they are ready for either or both.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>In a booklet entitled “Education and Race Relations” distributed
to its 20,000 members, the Farm Bureau proposed the development of
a “co-racial program” of separate but equal schools. By co-racial the
Bureau meant “equal status, equal opportunity and self-determination.”
If facilities were truly equal, contended the Bureau, there would be
“more gracious acceptance” of segregation by both races and “no white
or Negro child” would be “forced to attend a school of mixed races, unwillingly.”
Since segregation would, under these circumstances, be
maintained voluntarily both the spirit and the letter of the court
decision would be observed. The success of this program would depend
on voluntary acceptance by both races. Again significantly, no
provision was made to accommodate those pupils seeking integrated
schools.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Record’s</cite> proposals merit special attention since in reality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
they cracked the door to school integration. It recommended a system
(consequently adopted in part in North Carolina) which would
allow Negroes in “a few rare instances” to attend white schools.
Such a system, which would have assigned pupils to schools on
factors other than race, would comply with the Court’s decision and
at the same time maintain segregation almost 100 percent intact.
Under the system “an occasional white pupil” would have to be
assigned to a Negro school. The <cite>Record</cite> also recommended repeal
of all of South Carolina’s segregation laws as a means of removing
the basis for further court rulings against the state.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Independent</cite>, though less concerned with the segregation issue,
had its own homespun suggestions as to how to circumvent the Court.
Comparing resistance to integration with opposition to the Eighteenth
Amendment, it suggested that the time might come “when segregated
education will be ‘bootlegged’ and when federal agents, slinking
behind hedges, will try to follow little Johnny to the ‘speakeasy’
school.” However, there would be plenty of old timers who could
give Johnny “some valuable tips on how to confound the revenooers.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Not a few urged defiance to the point of violence in resistance to
integration. Others, less extreme in their utterances, helped create
a climate of disrespect for the segregation decision which made defiance
easier. “Because the Supreme Court has spoken we should
not submit without resistance,” said Senator Thurmond. South Carolinians,
he added, “must resist integration by every legal means
harder than the integrationists fought to end segregation.” The <cite>News
and Courier</cite> asserted that “the will to resist goes deep into the fabric
of the Southern people. They do not intend to yield their principles
so long as they draw breath.” Commenting on the integration violence
in Clinton, Tennessee, it declared that “organized rebellion at
the local level” was “a wasteful and disturbing means of dealing with
government.” But Southern states should not “give an inch in standing
up to the federal government.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Despite the intransigent opposition that had developed to integration
in the state and the South generally by the summer of 1955,
W. D. Workman, Jr., despaired of the “blight of submissiveness” which
the Court decision had spread over the land. The “cry of surrender”
by those who would accept the decision as law did not “fit well into
the traditional pattern of American resistance to dictation,” he declared.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
A number of letters to the editor of the <cite>News and Courier</cite>
were of the same opinion.</p>

<p>Occasional outbreaks of violence have come in South Carolina as a
result of the integration “agitation.” These have been rare, however;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the threat of violence was usually sufficient. The most prominent
case of violence involved the Reverend J. A. DeLaine, an African
Methodist Episcopal Church minister<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and leader of one of the
organizations sponsoring the school case from Clarendon County,
where he had a pastorate. Later he was transferred to Lake City.
DeLaine’s church in Lake City was destroyed by a fire of undetermined
origin; his home was pelted with rocks, fruits and other
objects from passing automobiles. On one occasion DeLaine, claiming
that the occupants of a passing automobile had fired gunshots
into his home, shot back. Two of the men were slightly injured
by metal fragments from the car. The men in the car maintained that
they had not fired and were in fact unarmed. As a result of this
incident DeLaine fled to New York City, seeking refuge with an AME
bishop. In South Carolina he was indicted for assault with intent
to kill. Federal authorities took no action to return DeLaine to
South Carolina. Governor Timmerman, stating that he did not want
to give the NAACP another martyr who could be used for fund raising,
decided not to press for extradition. South Carolina was well rid of
“this professional agitator,” commented Timmerman.</p>

<p>Some two years later DeLaine, interviewed at New Rochelle, N. Y.,
where he was serving as pastor of the Mount Carmel Church, asserted
that his experiences in South Carolina had permanently scarred both
him and the members of his family. However, he added: “It’s
worth some suffering—it’s even worth a man’s life, if he can start
something that will lead to a little more justice for people.... We
helped start some things that are bringing a revolution in education
for Negroes in South Carolina, in modern schools and bus transportation.”
Nor did the minister harbor any ill feelings toward the people
of South Carolina. “There are too many good people there, white
and colored. But they need to stand up against the hate-mongers,”
he declared.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>A second notable incident of violence, which took place in December,
1956, involved the flogging of a Camden High School band leader,
Guy Hutchins, by six hooded men. According to Hutchins, he was
attacked while changing an automobile tire on a lonely road. His
assailants accused him of making remarks in favor of racial integration,
a charge which Hutchins flatly denied.</p>

<p>Although the Kershaw County grand jury on two different occasions
refused to indict six men arrested in connection with the case, many
white South Carolinians publicly criticized the incident. The Rev.
Stiles B. Lines, pastor of the Camden Episcopal Church of which
Hutchins was a member, declared that “fear covers South Carolina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
like the frost.” Referring to the flogging, he told his parishioners:
“Men are afraid to speak. Freedom of speech is almost extinct in
South Carolina, except for those who wish to speak in favor of and
in accord with the policies of the pressure groups who self-righteously
assume that they, and only they, have the answers.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Criticism of the Hutchins affair was sufficiently widespread to
cause the steering committee of the Kershaw County Citizens Council
to meet in special session and issue a statement declaring that “unlawful
acts of violence, force or intimidation serve only to bring
discredit on this community and state, and, insofar as concerns the
struggle against integration, the loss of States’ Rights and loss of
individual liberties, to cause diversion, dissension and dismay among
those who are attempting to maintain our traditional social order
and way of life.”</p>

<p>The comments made by South Carolina Circuit Judge G. Duncan
Bellinger of Columbia on the Supreme Court’s desegregation decision
were an interesting sidelight on the Hutchins incident. They were
voiced in his charge to the grand jury considering the indictment
of the six men accused of the flogging. Members of the Court, said
the judge, had “substituted for legal principles their own personal,
social, economic and political ideas, taking away the rights of states,
the powers of the departments of the federal government and the
rights of individual citizens.” But in urging an indictment of the
accused, Bellinger declared that violence would aid only the “scalawags
and carpetbaggers” who were seeking to bring about another
Reconstruction.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> By inference the judge considered fighting the
“scalawags and carpetbaggers” as important as the rights of individual
citizen Guy Hutchins.</p>

<p>Under circumstances and conditions such as those outlined above
South Carolina developed its resistance to attempts of the Negro to
win integration. The unanimity of opinion among those elements
which spoke out on the subject encouraged silence among more
moderate persons. Such a situation is further illustrated by a more
detailed consideration of the various phases of resistance.</p>

<h3>THE WHITE FOLKS FIGHT BACK</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent10 unindent">We are surrounded by invisible dangers, against which
nothing can protect us, but our foresight and energy.—<cite>John
C. Calhoun</cite></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>In response to the Supreme Court’s desegregation decision a number
of organizations dedicated to the preservation of white supremacy
mushroomed up in the state. Among these were the National Association
for the Advancement of White People, the States Rights League,
the Grass Roots League, American Educators Incorporated, the Federation
for Constitutional Government, the Association for the Preservation
of Southern Traditions and the Citizens Council. In addition
the Ku Klux Klan again reared its ugly head. These organizations
opposed racial integration with methods that varied from the “legal”
opposition of the Citizens Council to the blunt threats of naked force
by the Ku Klux Klan. Similarly, they experienced differing degrees
of success. The Citizens Council, though last to be organized, has
been the most prominent. With the exception of the Citizens Council,
none of the organizations developed anything approaching a statewide
following. Its appearance in the summer of 1955 virtually signalized
the disappearance of the other groups. Only the Ku Klux Klan remains.</p>

<p>The Klan is the largest and most important of the white supremacy
groups next to the Citizens Council. As it exists in the state during
the period following the Supreme Court’s ruling on school segregation,
the Klan is a continuation of the organization that had become
almost defunct by the late 1940’s and early 1950’s. The Court decision
gave the Klan a new lease on life. However, it has not been
able to achieve recognition as the state’s chief defender of racial
segregation. Essentially this results from the fact that the Klan,
because of its checkered history since World War I, has no appeal
among “respectable” elements, in short to the state’s “power structure.”
The bedsheet brigade also has the official opposition of the
state government.</p>

<p>In general the South Carolina Ku Kluxers have found greatest
following among the less economically privileged whites, workingmen
and petty tradesmen. Klan rallies, replete with burning crosses and
fiery oratory, have been held at various points throughout the state.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
Attendance, as reported by the press, usually has varied from less
than a hundred to several hundred, though Klan leaders argue that
these figures are much too low. At one meeting in Union, the Klan
claimed an attendance of between 12,000 and 15,000.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Several independent Klan factions have been organized in the state.
The national organization, with headquarters in Atlanta, recognizes
the group headed by Grand Dragon J. H. Bickley, a Marion carpenter,
as the “official” Klan in South Carolina. Bickley’s organization has
been bothered by periodic Klan rallies which it has not sponsored and
which engage in practices which, according to the Grand Dragon,
tend to discredit his group and alienate its followers. Since Bickley
refuses to release any information on the number of Klansmen or
klaverns in the state, the numerical strength of the Klan is impossible
to determine. He claims that if he had the time, he “could
stage a rally each night of the week.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The purpose of the Klan according to E. L. Edwards of Atlanta,
the national Imperial Wizard, is to protect Southerners “against the
NAACP, Knights of Columbus and the ADL [Anti-Defamation
League].” The Klan is “a white man’s organization fighting for
white supremacy” and is not made up of race discriminators but people
who want to live “in a segregated group.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> On the basis of stated aims
and objectives, there is no discernible difference between the Klan of
the 1920’s and that of the 1950’s.</p>

<p>Klan leaders deliver impassioned harangues at klavern rallies.
Their principal foes, as evidenced by the organizations singled out
by Edwards, are Negroes, Jews and to a somewhat lesser extent
Catholics. Liberal use is made of the smear technique of accusing
opponents of being pro-Communist. Speaking at Sumter Imperial
Wizard Edwards charged that the Supreme Court’s ruling was “a
Communist-Jewish-Catholic plot” aimed at “destroying and mongrelizing”
the white race. Parties to this conspiracy included Franklin
D. Roosevelt, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, “the Jew Bernard Baruch,”
and President Eisenhower, whom he referred to as “Eisenberger.”
With characteristic disregard for historical accuracy, the Imperial
Wizard branded the NAACP as an organization formed in 1906 by a
“group of three people sent directly from Russia.” He urged all “one
hundred percent Protestant white Americans” to join the Klan and
help overcome this menace.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>At a Timmonsville meeting Ku Klux attitudes were well expressed
by a Klan speaker identified only as a “minister of the Gospel” who
would be in his pulpit the following Sunday morning. After the opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
prayer, this defender of the faith announced that he hated all
Jews and “niggers.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The NAACP [he continued] is a Communist front organization. We have
documents in the House Un-American Activities Committee to prove this. I
was supposed to have literature here tonight to prove this, but it was late in
arriving....</p>

<p>The main issue in South Carolina is not so much Communism as it is niggerism....</p>

<p>Klansmen don’t wear sheets, they wear robes. It is a shame that good
Christian people have to hide themselves to do what our country was founded

Activities Committee as a Communist....</p>

<p>I’d rather (my little boy) grow up unable to read or write than sit beside a
nigger in school.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Another speaker, standing on the flat bed of a Ford truck, told a
Klan rally that Henry Ford <abbr title="Two">II</abbr> had given $1,500,000 to the NAACP
and that he (the speaker) would boycott all Ford products until Ford
gave an equal amount to a white supremacy group.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Klan speakers invariably include a thinly veiled threat against
those who seek to upset racial segregation. The Grand Dragon of
South Carolina warned that “the day the Negro steps into a white
South Carolina school as a student will be the day we pick up our
weapons.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> A “preacher” told another rally that “moderation has
never been the answer to anything. It’s the extremists—you and
me—who are going to solve this situation.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The lengths to which Klan “extremists” are willing to go, or more
accurately the depths to which they can descend, is illustrated by
an episode which occurred at Traveler’s Rest in Greenville County
which is in the upper part of the state. On the night of July 21, 1957,
eleven white men broke into the home of Claude Cruell, a moderately
prosperous fifty-eight year old Negro farmer and Baptist deacon.
Four of them proceeded to chain him up and beat him. The others
watched. During the course of the beating, according to Cruell’s
wife, Fannie, who was subsequently driven away several miles from
the farm and made to walk home, the invaders berated the Negro
couple for “trying to mix with white people.”</p>

<p>Specifically, the group was referring to the Cruells’ association
with Sherwood Turner and his family. Turner, a tall, illiterate thirty-four
year old white man who eked out a precarious livelihood as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
itinerant bean picker and handyman, lived with his wife and seven
small children in a nearby house which they rented from Cruell for
five dollars a month. On occasion, the Negro farmer had given Turner
and his family rides in his car to nearby bean fields. On the day
of the beating the Cruells were caring for Turner’s children while
the latter had taken his wife, a thin, anemic woman, to the Stroud
Memorial Hospital at Marietta for emergency treatment for a kidney
ailment. The Turner children, consequently, witnessed the beating
of Cruell.</p>

<p>A police investigation led directly to the independent Greenville
County Ku Klux Klan. It was A. Marshall Rochester, head of the
Greenville Klansmen, who led the “inquisitional” party to the Cruell
farm. They had intended to whip not only Cruell but also the pitiful
Mrs. Turner. Rochester openly acknowledged his role in the affair.
Eight of the other men arrested with him not only in connection with
the Cruell beating but also that of another Negro, Willie Lewis Brown,
on July 29th, admitted membership in the Klan; a tenth said that he
was a “probationary” member, and the eleventh identified himself
as its “chaplain.”</p>

<p>The Cruell incident brought an indignant protest from Grand Dragon
Bickley who denounced the Greenville Klansmen. He expressed “great
pleasure” that the incidents of violence in Greenville had been solved
by law enforcement authorities and held that such episodes resulted
“only in harmful effects upon the South and our nation as a whole.”
He carefully pointed out that his own organization had no acts of
violence charged against it and also that it was not on the Attorney
General’s subversive list. “This is due to the fact,” said Bickley,
“that in all our chartered klaverns, the klansmen are taught to respect
law and order.”</p>

<p>When the Klansmen were finally brought to trial after an indictment
by a grand jury all but six were exonerated by Judge James M. Brailsford,
Jr., who ordered charges against them dismissed. The trial jury
found two others innocent. The remaining four, including Rochester,
were found guilty of conspiracy and assault and battery and sentenced
to jail terms ranging from one to six years. Rochester received the
maximum six year sentence from Judge Brailsford who remarked:
“I don’t see that I can accomplish any good by lecturing these men.”
He was undoubtedly right.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The press of the state has universally harrassed the Klan not only
in the Cruell episode but in its other activities as well. The <cite>Morning
News</cite> referred to the organization as “this blasphemy against religion;
this living curse against decency; this social cancer that pollutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
everyone and every area it touches.” The <cite>Independent</cite> called the
Klan a “latter-day bedsheet brigade” which appealed only to the
“mentally immature” who had “something to hide.” The <cite>News and
Courier</cite> believed that it was made up of “hotheads, crackpots and
brutes,” who went “night riding for sport” and did more harm than
good for the cause of segregation.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Not only does the Klan have to contend with a hostile press but
it also faces opposition from the state government. Governor Timmerman
quixotically charged that the reorganization of the Klan was
the work of the Communist Party. In early 1956 the South Carolina
Klan applied for a state charter. Attorney General Callison ruled
against this request on the ground that Klan ritual called for the
wearing of robes and hoods, which was illegal under the state’s anti-masking
law.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Previously Callison had joined other Southern attorneys
general in a declaration which pledged joint action to “use
every legal means” to check Klan growth and expose its “secret and
unlawful purposes.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The attorney general’s actions were applauded
by the press.</p>

<p>Public support of the Klan is rare. An occasional letter to the
editor has defended the order. The writer of one such letter to the
<cite>News and Courier</cite>, for example, had “never heard of the Klu Klux
Klan bothering anyone who did not need a double-dose of what they
got.” Neither had he ever known of the Klan taking the law into
its own hands until “the law had been notified, and had failed to take
action.” Because of the nature of the Communist conspiracy, he was
in “favor of America waking up” even if the Klan had to do the
waking.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Another letter writer to the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, one C. A.
Rea of Hamlet, North Carolina, a town close to the South Carolina
border, said that he had attended several KKK rallies and was sure
that Klansmen did “not want any trouble.” Rea, who concluded his
letter with “Yours for Christianity, segregation, and decency,” praised
South Carolina law enforcement officers “for their fairness and cooperation”
at Klan rallies. “They recognize and respect constitutional
rights of peaceful assembly and of free speech,” he declared.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The other white supremacy groups, nearly all of which had short
existences, were less well known than the Klan. One of these, the
National Association for the Advancement of White People, apparently
had only one chapter in the state. This group was located at
Florence and affiliated with a national organization led by Bryant
Bowles who achieved a fleeting notoriety in connection with his attempts
to prevent school integration in Delaware and Washington,
D.C. The NAAWP, according to its national president, represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the white man’s “last hope” against the NAACP. He pledged to fight
the “trend from communism to liberalism and then to negroism in the
United States.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The Florence chapter was headed by G. L. Ivey, a restaurant owner,
who fired all of his Negro employees immediately after the Supreme
Court decision of May 17, 1954. The pronouncements of Ivey and
Bowles were similar to those made by some of the more outspoken
members of the Klan. What the Negro really wanted, Ivey told white
Carolinians, was “to get into your front bedroom.” Bowles protested
that he was not anti-Semitic but added “the Jews are fast making
me that way” through their support of the NAACP.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Morning News</cite> condemned the NAAWP as being “at least as
undesirable” as the opposition it proposed to combat—the NAACP.
The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, professing to know little concerning the organization,
was inclined “not to endorse such a movement.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Such
criticism may have discouraged white supremacists elsewhere in the
state from forming NAAWP chapters.</p>

<p>In March, 1955, apparently because of failure of the organization
on both the local and national level, the Florence chapter reconstituted
itself as the Florence County Chapter of the States Rights
League.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The States Rights League was another abbreviated attempt to combat
integration. It had a few chapters in lowcountry counties, e.g.
Charleston, Darlington, Florence, but never achieved more than a
tiny numerical strength. Its purposes, though couched in constitutional
terms, were essentially the same as those of other white supremacy
groups. The Darlington chapter of the League, in applying
for a state charter, listed its objectives as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>To promote constitutional government, including the preservation of the independence
of the legislative, executive and judicial departments; the preservation
of the sovereign rights of state government and the preservation of individual
liberties guaranteed by the Federal Constitution....</p>

<p>To oppose the adoption of socialistic platforms; to seek in every Christian
and legal manner the strongest opposition to decisions of the Federal Courts and
the Supreme Court, which wrongly abrogated, modified or amended the provisions
of the U. S. Constitution which require a separation of power between
the three great branches of government....<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Spokesmen for the League were more blunt in stating their objectives.
A member of the Darlington chapter declared that the League was
seeking “to preserve Christianity, segregation, states rights and individual
liberties.” The “sole purpose” of the League, announced
G. L. Ivey, was “to maintain segregation.” He urged “every white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
man and woman” who believed that segregation provided “the only
stable arrangement for mutual respect and right conduct between
the races” to join the League.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>In promoting constitutional government, the Florence County States
Rights League concerned itself with such momentous issues as passing
a resolution demanding the resignation of the Reverend E. L. Byrd,
a Florence Baptist minister, who had advocated “the mixing of the
white and Negro races” in churches. In another equally dramatic
action the League adopted and sent to officials of the Florence County
Agricultural Building a resolution requesting that officials correct a
situation wherein whites and Negroes had to use the same drinking
fountain in the building. This move was taken following a report
by a league member that he had seen a “bunch of little Negro children
all around the white drinking fountain like a swarm of bees around a
saucer of syrup.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Another of the ephemeral Class B white supremacy groups was
the Grass Roots League of Charleston. President of the League was
the elderly Stanley F. Morse. Though highly vocal, the Grass Rooters
were numerically insignificant. Their method of attack was through
the issuance of “Research Bulletins.” Bulletin No. 2, for example,
“proved” that the NAACP “was infiltrated by the Communist party
in 1925.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Bulletin No. 3 accused the National Council of Churches
of distributing “leftist propaganda” which echoed “the subtle Marxist
line that the South must give up its constitutional States Rights and
necessary local customs in accordance with the Supreme Court’s left-wing
segregation ruling.” This Bulletin was prepared by the League’s
Religious Affairs Committee whose chairman, Micah Jenkins, was
later to become president of the state Citizens Council organization.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The purpose of the Grass Roots League, as stated by its president,
was to combat the “threat to the continued existence of our free American
Republic,” a threat which resulted from the Supreme Court’s
segregation ruling. Various facets of this threat included the “Communist
aim” of weakening “America’s constructive white civilization
by mongrelization;” the attempt of the Supreme Court to seize legislative
powers and destroy the principle of States Rights; the Supreme
Court’s surrender to “political expediency” in cooperating with the
Eisenhower administration’s “unscrupulous effort to win the Negro
vote;” and “the cowardly reluctance of too many Southern businessmen,
newspapers, radio stations, etc.,” to support resistance to “the
black phases of the Red revolution.” Almost two years later, in
February, 1957, Morse further expounded his views on the integration
controversy in a letter to the editor of the <cite>News and Courier</cite>: “In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
brief the racial issue is political and biological—not religious. Since
it is promoted by the atheistic Reds, it is anti-Christian. If the pro-Negro
drive of the Communists succeeds, our United States may be
wiped out and Christianity may receive a terrible setback. It is
incredible that many clergymen and other ‘intellectuals’ are so unfamiliar
with the laws of God (natural laws) and the facts of history
that they have been duped into participating in this pagan attack on
our civilization.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Still another transitory organization combatting racial equality
was the American Educators, Incorporated, with headquarters in
Hartsville. The American Educators apparently consisted of little
more than their president, George W. Waring, who was connected
with other similar groups, notably the States Rights League. Chartered
in August, 1955, the American Educators sought to instruct the
public to “the dangers of the communistic, socialistic, left wing, and
modernistic trends to destroy Christianity and other religious faiths,
the Constitution of the United States, individual liberties, high morals
and self respect.” President Waring favored the application of economic
pressures against “all members and sympathizers of the NAACP
as well as any other communist-dominated organizations.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The Federation for Constitutional Government with headquarters
in New Orleans is a “national” coordinating organization for white
resistance groups. It has affiliates in South Carolina, notably among
the Citizens Councils. The Federation was organized in December,
1955, in Memphis, Tennessee, by representatives from twelve Southern
and border states and a sprinkling of delegates (self-appointed) from
other states. Among the South Carolinians attending were Micah
Jenkins, who was elected to the Executive Committee of the Federation,
and Congressman L. Mendel Rivers of Charleston, who offered
a resolution, adopted by the Convention, supporting interposition.
Present at the Memphis meeting were many persons prominent in
pro-segregation organizations such as the Citizens Councils and rightist
organizations such as We the People and For America. The motives
which brought these elements together, according to the <cite>News and
Courier</cite>, were the same as those which guided “the founders of our
Republic”—“the preservation of rights and freedoms built on centuries
of Anglo-Saxon culture.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>In the development of organized resistance to integration efforts,
the Citizens Council has emerged as the most effective opponent of
the NAACP. The Council was a relatively late comer to the state,
first appearing in the summer of 1955, a full year after the Court’s
original ruling. The “need” for an organization which would rally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
“moderate” and “respectable” whites was apparent to many segregationist
leaders. The Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacy
groups were unable to generate anything approaching popular support
and furthermore they represented not particularly desirable white
elements. In May, 1955, Farley Smith, son of the late Senator “Cotton
Ed” Smith, complained of the “apathy of the average white citizen”
toward pro-segregation movements and urged establishment of a
white counterpart of the NAACP. Smith, S. Emory Rogers, the
Summerton attorney who helped argue the Clarendon school case,
and others recognized the Council as the answer to the undermining
of segregation by the NAACP. The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, too, believed
that the Citizens Council might succeed in steadying the shaking
“foundations of the Republic” by providing leadership of the type
which was “sorely needed” in the “uncertain times” of 1955.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The Citizens Council idea originated in Indianola, Mississippi, where
the first Council was formed in July, 1954. The movement spread
rapidly throughout the South. In the late summer of 1955 Thomas
R. Waring of the <cite>News and Courier</cite> wrote a series of articles on the
Mississippi Councils to acquaint South Carolinians as to their nature
and purpose with a view to encouraging the creation of similar groups
in the state. He reported that the Councils proposed “to preserve
separation of the races” against the combined assaults of the NAACP
and the federal government. At the same time they allegedly were
dedicated to the protection of rank and file Negroes “from the wrath
of ruffian white people.” Membership in the Councils, said Waring,
was recruited from “private, patriotic citizens,” who were the “pillars
of the community.” Council members were citizens who “run the
Chamber of Commerce and the Community Chest, serve as officers
of churches and do the civic chores in every town worthy of the name.”
Meeting the criticism of liberals both in the North and the South,
Waring stated that Council leaders were “in no sense the architects
of an American Fascist movement.” On the contrary, they were
“firm supporters of the Republic and Jeffersonian democracy.” The
Councils screened all potential members carefully “for character and
dependability, as well as for their determination to keep the races
separate,” and accepted only those who could be trusted with “the
powers of organized civic righteousness.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The aims of the Citizens Council do not, in fact, differ particularly
from those of other white supremacy groups; in its methods, however,
the Council places greater emphasis on economic pressure, legal resistance
and respectability. Its members wear business suits instead
of bedsheets. In 1956 the State Legislature adopted a resolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
commending the Citizens Councils in South Carolina as organizations
designed</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>to preserve and maintain proper relations between all races residing in the State
of South Carolina; to oppose the use of force by radicals and reactionaries; to
disseminate information concerning radicals and reactionaries who may attempt
to disrupt the peace and good relations among the races; to make every legal
and moral effort to maintain the segregated public schools of the state; to study
and develop ways and means for providing adequate education for children of
all races in the State of South Carolina in the event that radical agitators should
force the abandonment of the public schools; to operate segregated public schools
by agreement between the races on a voluntary basis; to acquaint public officials
without the State of South Carolina with the conditions in our State which make
integration impossible; to acquaint such officials with the fact that the vast
majority of the citizens of our State, both white and colored, favor the continuance
of segregation in the public schools as now exists; to continue the
present American way of life; and for other eleemosynary purposes.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The emphasis on white supremacy is more apparent in a newspaper
advertisement of the Florence Council soliciting membership. After
describing the organization as the “modern version of the old town
meeting,” it stated that the “Council is the South’s answer to the
mongrelizers. We will not be integrated! We are proud of our white
blood and our white heritage of sixty centuries.” To do battle with
the “mongrelizers” the Council needed “every patriotic white Southerner,
rich or poor, high or low,” who was “proud of being a white American.”
All such persons were urged to join the Council for the protection
of “those baby children at home.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Micah Jenkins, president
of the Charleston Council, said the movement aimed “to promote better
race relations, and in every way preserve for the South its own way
of life.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The Reverend L. B. McCord, the Clarendon County school
superintendent and one of the founders of the Clarendon Council,
justified formation of the Councils on the ground that should an emergency
arise such organizations would be available to give it “thoughtful
and prayerful attention.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The immediate cause for the rapid growth of the Citizens Councils
in South Carolina was the appearance of the school integration petitions
in the summer of 1955. These petitions served as a catalyst to crystallize
the previously unorganized opposition among whites to integration.
The first Council was formed at Elloree in Orangeburg County in early
August, 1955, immediately following a petition by Negroes for school
integration. From this beginning the Councils spread rapidly throughout
the lowcountry and into several counties in the upper part of the
state. During the first year’s existence, Councils were formed at the
rate of better than one per week so that by July 1, 1956, South Carolina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
had 55 separate Councils.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Only a few have been added since that
date.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>In October, 1955, representatives from the various Councils met in
Columbia to lay the foundation for a statewide association. This was
effected in December, 1955. Micah Jenkins, a Charleston nurseryman,
was named state chairman and S. Emory Rogers executive secretary.
Inasmuch as the local Councils were autonomous, the purpose of the
state organization was to give overall coordination and direction to
activities on the state level. The state association had a speakers’
bureau and a legal advisory committee composed of one member from
each of the state’s judicial districts in which at least one Council was
organized. The board of directors was made up of one representative
from each county in which a Council had been organized. Membership
totals were not maintained by the state headquarters but were
variously estimated between 25,000 and 40,000 in the summer of 1956.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The South Carolina Citizens Councils are affiliated with the national
Citizens Councils of America which has headquarters in Greenwood,
Mississippi. The national organization published an official newspaper,
<cite>The Citizens Council</cite>, which had a circulation in early 1957 of
approximately 4,000. In 1957 <cite>The Citizens Council</cite> ran in serial form
“A Manual for Southerners,” a segregation handbook designed for public
school pupils. That portion designed for third and fourth graders
read in part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Negroes and white people do not go to the same places together. We live in
different parts of town. And we are kind to each other. This is called our Southern
Way of Life.</p>

<p>Do you know that some people in our country want the Negroes to live with
the white people? These people want us to be unhappy.... They want to make
our country weak....</p>

<p>Do you know what part of our country you live in? You live in the South....
We are called Southerners. Southerners are people who live in the South. You
are a Southerner. You live in the South....</p>

<p>God put the white people off by themselves. He put the yellow, red and black
people by themselves. God wanted the white people to live alone....</p>

<p>White men built America. The Negro came to our country after the white man
did. The white man has always been kind to the Negro. But the white and black
people do not live together in the South....</p>

<p>[Those who seek integration] say we are not good if we don’t live together.
But we know it is wrong to live together.... They want to make our country
weak. Did you know our country will grow weak if we mix our races? It will.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Although this quotation requires no comment either from the standpoint
of logic or historical accuracy, the reaction of Margaretta P.
Childs of Charleston is noteworthy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Such pontifical judgments [she wrote] may not edify the third grade pupil
for whom they are intended, but will surely amuse a wide audience all over the
country. The Mississippians’ intimate knowledge, perhaps even complicity in, the
Deity’s intentions will also catch the attention of the nation’s Biblical scholars
and theologians....</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the school child, if he learns any history or geography he
may be more perplexed than confirmed in a fine old Saxon interpretation of
divine will. If God wanted the white man ‘to live alone’, why did He send the
white man across the ocean to trespass on the lands of the red men or to make
long voyages to settle among the dark-skinned people of Africa and Asia?</p>

<p>The pamphlet in its ‘simple, easy-to-read style’ will not fool the children for
long and will furnish lots of jokes to observers of the Southern scene. Too bad
that H. L. Mencken, keenest critic of bigotry, false sentiment, and hypocrisy,
is not around to enjoy and lampoon this latest tasteless expression of the cracker
mentality. The intellectual bankruptcy of the die-hard segregationists is clearly
shown for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Local Councils maintain several committees, each charged with specific
functions. An information and education committee is assigned
to gather and disseminate information on racial problems on all levels.
A committee on politics and elections has the responsibility of studying
candidates for political office and presenting their qualifications to the
voters. A membership and finance committee seeks to enlist “all
patriotic white citizens for membership” and thus assure the organization
of support. Membership fees are generally set at $5.00. A legal
advisory committee provides “legal knowledge” to the Council in its
fight against integration.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Some of the Councils are organized on a
countywide basis while others correspond to a local school district.</p>

<p>The Citizens Councils have quickly endeavored to make their influence
felt in the political arena. Although the state organization
declares that it will “steer clear of partisan politics,” it nonetheless
exerts direct political pressure. Using its power “for principles, not
persons; for causes, not individuals,” the state Council makes sure that
all candidates hold orthodox views on the race question. The aim is
not so much to endorse particular candidates but to insure that all
are “safe.” As the <cite>News and Courier</cite> noted, the Council aimed “to
give support to strong officials and put backbone into weak ones.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>In the state elections of 1956 the Council submitted to the candidates
a list of questions designed to detect any deviation from orthodoxy on
the race issue. The most revealing of these asked: “Do you here and
now promise not to seek the Negro vote directly or indirectly?”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> A
joint statement in reply to the queries by five of the six members of
the state’s delegation to the House of Representatives—L. Mendel
Rivers, John J. Riley, W. J. Bryan Dorn, Robert J. Ashmore and John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
L. McMillan—reflected the attitudes of South Carolina politicians.
Said the representatives:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We believe continued segregation to be in the best interest of South Carolina
and the United States. Our country is threatened from abroad and from within
by an atheistic menace which will stoop to any methods to create unrest and
disunity. South Carolina’s record of tolerance, patriotism and understanding
is second to that of no other state. It is far superior to that of some other states
which spawn the chief critics of our way of life and harbor fugitives from justice.</p>

<p>There are in South Carolina many patriotic colored citizens who are not
misled by outside agitation and who are working at the local level with our
white citizens to solve this complex problem.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The votes of such Negroes, continued the congressmen, would and
should be welcomed by all South Carolina politicians.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Political leaders, the state press and other moulders of public opinion
endorse the Citizens Council in its role as spokesman for “the Southern
way of life.” Indicative was the appearance of Senators Thurmond
and Johnston, Representatives Rivers and Riley, former Governor
Byrnes, State Representative Burnet R. Maybank, Jr., and others of
less political note at a Council rally held in Columbia. Senator James
O. Eastland of Mississippi, the principal speaker, told his audience
that the Supreme Court decision had been “dictated by political pressure
groups bent upon the destruction of the American system of government
and bent upon the mongrelization of the white race.” In
making the decision, the Court had “responded to a radical pro-communist
political movement.” Senator Thurmond commended the
Councils for the “orderly and lawful manner” in which they had approached
the “problem” created by the Supreme Court decision.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Among the state press, the <cite>News and Courier</cite> has become a sort of
unofficial organ for the Councils. The Charleston paper presents these
organizations as “moderate and sound” in approach and representative
of a “deep public sentiment” against integration. To the <cite>News and
Courier</cite> the movement is evidence that the South has “not shrunk
from revolution and rebellion,” words which were “honorable” when
the cause was just.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The <cite>Record</cite> endorses the Councils but the <cite>Independent</cite>,
reflecting upcountry distrust of lowcountry domination of the
Councils, expresses little interest in the movement.</p>

<p>Scattered opposition has developed amongst the South Carolina
white population to the Councils. Initially, the <cite>Morning News</cite> mildly
condemned them, stating that their appearance was “tacit admission”
that the NAACP occupied a position of superiority in the segregation
controversy.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Stronger protest has come from the South Carolina
Methodist Church. In a statement adopted at its annual conference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
in 1955—before the Citizens Councils had consolidated their position
in the state—the Methodist leaders condemned the movement. They
noted that “it is properly supposed that these councils are being formed
for the express purpose of exerting economic pressure upon a portion
of our citizenry to prevent the exercise and development of their moral
conscience and their civil rights according to the dictates of their
consciences.” Such action, declared the Methodists, was a “contradiction
of the basic teachings of our Lord and Master.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The national
executive council of the AFL-CIO has approved a report that contained
an especially strong condemnation of the Councils. The labor
leaders referred to them as “this new Ku Klux Klan without hoods”
whose actions bore “ominous” resemblance “to the pattern of the
growth of Naziism and other totalitarian movements which have fed
on hatred and defied constitutional democracy.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Expressing similar
sentiments, Thurgood Marshall said that “the really vicious part about
these groups” was the creation of an “atmosphere of respectability” in
which other less scrupulous groups could “intimidate, threaten, beat
up and kill Negroes.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The principal method used by the Citizens Councils in opposing
integration is the economic boycott. This policy, which belies professed
reliance on constitutional forms of opposition, has been employed
from the very beginning. Leaders of the Elloree Council declared
their immediate purpose was to exert “economic pressure on
all persons connected with the NAACP.” Specifically, these spokesmen
were referring to the seventeen Negro parents who had signed the
petition seeking the end of race discrimination in Elloree public schools.
The effectiveness of the policy was indicated within two weeks following
the formation of the Council. Several Negro petitioners lost their
jobs or were peremptorily evicted from their farms as a consequence
of which fourteen of them asked that their names be removed because
they “did not fully understand the meaning of the language of the
petition” at the time of their signature.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>The overall object of the economic boycott has been to discourage
all persons sympathetic to the idea of integration. Because of their
generally inferior economic status, Negroes are especially vulnerable
to such pressures. In areas where the boycott has been invoked any
Negro who did not support segregation could expect to find business
and personal credit withheld, home mortgages and installment loans
denied, employment terminated or refused, rental quarters barred to
him, and business and professional patronage withdrawn.</p>

<p>The city of Orangeburg provides an excellent study of the way in
which the economic boycott operates. Located about fifty miles southeast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
of Columbia, Orangeburg had a population in 1950 of approximately
15,000. It is the county seat of Orangeburg County, a predominantly
agricultural area the population of which is approximately
fifty percent Negro. The white population of Orangeburg had always
considered the city a model of “biracial amity, interracial cooperation,
and educational progress.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> This attitude prevailed until fifty-seven
Negroes petitioned for public school integration in the summer
of 1955. The white citizenry was stunned by this action, considering
it a breach of good faith on the part of the Negro parents. Reaction
was instantaneous. A Citizens Council was organized which immediately
began a policy of economic pressure against the petitioners.
A number of prominent businessmen joined the boycott and several
Negro retail merchants among the petitioners found their supply of
such basic commodities as bread and milk curtailed. White merchants
refused to extend credit to the petitioners and asked that all outstanding
accounts be settled immediately. The white community terminated
financial assistance that had previously been available to petitioners.</p>

<p>Negro leaders, realizing that economic pressure was a two-edged
sword, immediately began retaliating in kind against those merchants
prominent in the Citizens Council boycott. Since Negroes represented
approximately fifty percent of Orangeburg’s population, their
counter boycott was of considerable proportion and keenly felt by
many white merchants. A boycott list of twenty-three local firms was
distributed among the Negro community. It included only the more
outspoken of the white boycott leaders and those most dependent on
Negro trade. According to <cite>Reporter</cite> magazine, at least one white retail
merchant was put out of business.</p>

<p>More positive steps were also taken to aid the Negro boycott victims.
A fund, eventually reaching approximately $50,000, was deposited in
the Victory Savings Bank, a Negro institution in Columbia, and was
made available for small loans to Orangeburg Negroes. This fund
included $20,000 donated by the NAACP, $5,000 deposited by an unidentified
Catholic church, and $5,000 deposited by the National Council
of Churches. The Negroes cooperated among themselves in other
ways to help make their counter-boycott effective.</p>

<p>Accompanying the two-sided economic boycott was a general breakdown
in race relations. To a suggestion by Negro ministers that they
hold joint prayer services to help solve the problem, the white ministerial
alliance of Orangeburg replied, “This is not the time” for praying
together.</p>

<p>Boycott and counter-boycott reached an impasse and in the spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
of 1956 both sides realized the desirability for compromise. The whites
made several concessions, notably the resignation of Council Chairman
W. T. C. Bates who had been largely responsible for the extreme position
taken by the whites. With both sides easing up on the economic
boycott, there was a general lessening of tension. However, neither
side would compromise the basic issue. Negro parents continue to
demand an end to school segregation (the number of petitioners was
reduced by the boycott from fifty-seven to twenty-six); whites continue
to stand adamantly against ending school segregation.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>An important incident in the Orangeburg controversy was the protest
against intimidation by the student body and certain faculty members
of the State Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes. The
college is the only state supported institution of higher education for
Negroes in South Carolina. Its presence in Orangeburg gives the local
Negro community an unusually well educated and effective leadership.
Several of the faculty members were at least sympathetic to the policies
of the NAACP. The anti-segregation sentiment of these and other
persons prominently connected with the college brought a request from
<abbr title="Representative">Rep.</abbr> Jerry M. Hughes, Jr. of Orangeburg for an investigation of
NAACP activities among the faculty and students. Consequently in
March 1956 the state legislature approved a resolution establishing
a nine-member committee to determine which individuals at the college
were “members of and sympathizers with” the NAACP; the extent
of participation of the faculty and students in the activities of the
NAACP; whether or not the faculty and students were “serving to
mislead the Negro citizens and foment and nurture ill feeling and misunderstanding
between the White and Negro races;” and if the activities
of the faculty and students were “detrimental to the welfare of
the college, its students and the State of South Carolina as a whole.”
The resolution described the NAACP as an organization dedicated to
the “fomenting and nurturing of a bitter feeling of unrest, unhappiness
and resentment among the members of the Negro race with their status
in the social and economic structure of the South.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Following adoption of this resolution, a portion of the student body
and faculty of the college framed its own resolution which condemned
“pressures and attempts at intimidation” being applied to the college
and expressed approval of the policies of the NAACP.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>As unrest among the student body grew, Governor Timmerman directed
the State Law Enforcement Division’s attention to “information
that certain subversive elements” might attempt to sponsor a
demonstration against the state government. He directed the law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
enforcement agency “to keep the situation under surveillance and to
arrest immediately any law violators.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>These incidents together with the white-Negro boycott then in effect
in Orangeburg led to a protest strike by the student body of the Negro
college. During the strike the students presented President Benner
C. Turner with a list of grievances which protested against the investigation
and the patronage by the college of certain Orangeburg business
firms operated by men prominent in the economic boycott against
Negroes. The strike lasted a week, achieving little for the students.
Fred Moore, student body president and leader of the strike, was
expelled from school. At the end of the year the contracts of several
faculty members were not renewed and some twenty-five students
were requested not to return.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>The investigating committee met in July, organized itself and selected
<abbr title="Representative">Rep.</abbr> James H. McFaddin of Clarendon County as chairman.
When the investigation began, committee members were told by the
compliant President Turner that since the student strike had been
ended and several faculty members dismissed, there was no longer
anything to investigate. Consequently after a perfunctory one-day
meeting, the committee held no further hearings.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Use of the economic boycott at Orangeburg and elsewhere has generally
been approved by the press of the state. Its dangers are realized
but the end is considered worth the risk. The <cite>Record</cite> has compared
the white boycott to Gandhi’s policy of “non-cooperation” (passive
resistance) against the British!<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Not surprisingly the policy
receives its most enthusiastic support from the <cite>News and Courier</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We would not encourage unfair retaliation against any citizen, whatever his
race, for free expression of opinion. This is a truly free country and people can
say or write whatever they wish.</p>

<p>In exercising this freedom, people must be ready to bear the consequences.
If those consequences include unpopularity, public dislike or refusal to do business
with them, they need not be surprised.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>On another occasion the <cite>News and Courier</cite> declared that “Negroes
wishing to engage in activities repugnant to white people are also
free to earn a living elsewhere.” To secure employment in the South,
Negroes should be willing “to observe community customs.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The policies of the Citizens Council at least temporarily have been
successful inasmuch as they have postponed an immediate showdown
on the school segregation issue. Just how long such unofficial measures
will continue to be successful is problematical.</p>

<h3>THE BROTHERHOOD OF SEGREGATED MEN</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent10 unindent">The ministers to our forefathers had the Bible, but not
Socialism; and for them segregation was compatible
with Christianity. Our modern ministers have the Bible
and Socialism; and for them segregation is incompatible
with Christianity. The only difference is Socialism. The
Bible hasn’t changed; and, if Socialism is omitted, segregation
and Christianity are still compatible.—<cite>S. Emory

</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>During the 1850’s the church provided one of the bulwarks in the
Southern defense of slavery. In that decade pro-slavery theologians
prepared elaborate treatises “proving” slavery divinely authorized.
The 1950’s finds the churches of South Carolina dangerously close to
taking a similar position—only this time on segregation. Religious
groups of the later period, however, are less unanimous or enthusiastic
in support of “traditional race patterns.” In South Carolina, in fact,
a small number of ministers and laymen have opened the most important
crack in the solid wall of white segregationist sentiment. The
importance of their protest should not be overemphasized; in many
cases it is little more than academic. Protestant church organizations
have given no direct endorsement to the abolition of racial segregation.
The Methodist Church’s condemnation of the use of economic coercion
against Negroes by the Citizens Council has been to date the outstanding
criticism of white supremacy efforts by any Protestant group.</p>

<p>On the national level the church represents perhaps the most segregated
of all public institutions as Reinhold Niebuhr has so well pointed
out. Only a small fraction of church members, even in the North,
is associated with integrated churches. Nonetheless, national church
organizations outside the South have been making rapid progress in
removing all official barriers to church integration. This is also true
of most South-wide church organizations. The Southern Baptist Convention,
the Southern Presbyterian Assembly, and the Southeastern
Jurisdiction of the Methodist Church, for example, have all gone on
record as opposed to segregation based on race. These organizations
are much ahead of their South Carolina affiliates. Many leading segregationists,
who have always considered themselves staunch church
supporters, consequently are caught in a squeeze between church leadership
and their own attitudes toward segregation. This patently unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
situation has led some outspoken “Christian segregationists”
to question the church’s taking a stand on the issue. The <cite>News and
Courier</cite> wistfully hoped “that religion could be held above the complicated
social, political and economic features of the present debate over
race.” It was difficult enough “to fill churches with worshippers and
to insure financial support of religious work” even when people were
not being “alienated by social conflicts.” The “pressure in the churches”
for an end of segregation was “only one of the symptoms of a sick
world” which “plain people, guided by their own sure instincts, must
resist with all their might.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>In the best tradition of the Social Gospel, the <cite>Morning News</cite> initially
took the opposite view, holding that the church certainly “should
become interested in segregation. So long as we limit ministers to
talks of home, mother, God and country,” wrote Editor Jack H.
O’Dowd, “we won’t have a Christian nation, but a nation that tolerates
the seeds of Christian thought and influence.” More churchmen were
needed who were willing “to tie the power of Christianity to the problems
of living.” Yet in less than three months O’Dowd was criticizing
the Reverend Edward L. Byrd of Florence for attacking segregation.
He argued that while segregation could not be justified “on the basis
of Christianity and absolute morality,” it was “easily defended on the
grounds of public good and social expediency.” Religion was of “greatest
benefit” only when its application would “enrich the people. An
immediate application of the theory of segregation’s immorality would
not be a blessing to our Southland.” Disparaging Byrd’s call for
“courageous and Christian leadership” in facing the problem, the
<cite>Morning News</cite> stated that leadership was neither “a matter of blowing
the bugles of war from the rear” nor “a matter of leading your people
into destruction for a cause being fought the wrong way at the wrong
time.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Among the various Protestant religious denominations opponents
of integration have been either strong enough to prevent any action
from being taken or able to place the church on record as favoring a
continuation of racial segregation. The Methodist Church provides
perhaps the best example of a division of opinion. In October, 1954,
the annual conference of South Carolina Methodism by a vote of 289
to 148 adopted a resolution stating that the question of racial integration
in the public schools could “best be resolved on the state or local
level.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is apparent to us [said the resolution] that an attempt to integrate the
races in our public schools without regard to their relative numbers would work
grave injustice to many innocent persons, and in the present instance we fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the Negro would suffer most, as he has often when those far removed from his
every day problems have undertaken to speak in his name.</p>

<p>Consideration must also be given to the large number of Negro teachers and
administrators in our public schools, lest they be denied leadership among their
people.</p>

<p>To compel a parent, whether white or Negro, to send his child to school and
at the same time to compel the child to live under conditions which the parents
regard to be detrimental to the highest interest would, in our judgment, introduce
problems of serious import.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> applauded this statement as “a strong and
fearless stand,” “a common sense approach,” and “a more truly Christian
attitude than the twisting of ‘equality’ to mean forced association.”<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The following year, however, the Methodist Church’s annual conference
pulled the rug from under its more ardent segregationist friends.
On that occasion the conference officially recorded its opposition to the
Citizens Councils as organizations “formed for the express purpose of
exerting economic pressure.” This statement, introduced by the Reverend
A. McKay Brabham, Jr., of Aiken, and the Reverend J. B. Murray
of Orangeburg County, drew only scattered negative votes.</p>

<p>Reaction throughout the state was almost unanimously hostile. The
Methodists’ resolution, declared the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, “is not necessarily
a full reflection either of the facts or of the sentiments of most
churchmen in South Carolina. It is one thing to regard our fellowmen
as all God’s creatures. It is quite another thing meekly to submit to
pressure against customs and convictions held by our people these
many centuries.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> L. B. McCord, a former Presbyterian minister,
thought it “not unChristian to fire or not hire anyone whose conduct
is not wholesome and [does not] contribute to the best interest in the
home or wherever that person may work.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The Kingstree Methodist
Church, in an especially strong condemnation of its parent body, was
still more emphatic. It charged that “too many leaders and ministers
in our Methodist Church have been saturated with propaganda and
even made to have a guilt complex with reference to the question of
integration of the races and have used their high offices as ministers
and writers, though innocently we hope, for the purpose of disseminating
propaganda which we believe is inspired by Communist or Communist-front
organizations.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>The extent of the opposition in some areas to the resolution is well
illustrated by the action of the Reverend J. B. Murray’s congregation
in forcing his removal from his Orangeburg County charge. In announcing
Reverend Murray’s transfer, Dr. Pierce E. Cook, the Orangeburg
District Superintendent for the Methodist Church, stated that
the Citizens Councils were “not as bad” as the resolution implied. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Councils, he said, were “trying to do something our people in this area
are in sympathy with.”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Another example of pressure on supporters of the resolution was
the case of the Reverend E. S. Jones of St. Paul’s Methodist Church of
Orangeburg. Less than two weeks after adoption of the resolution,
Jones, one of its prominent backers, felt constrained to declare publicly:
“I have from the beginning felt that it was unwise for the races
to be thrown together in the public schools, and I have not changed
from that position. It is my conviction that the Church and its
ministry must always be positively Christian, not only in its ends
but in the ways and means adopted to attain these ends.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Only the maverick <cite>Morning News</cite> found any merit in the Methodist
stand. The Conference’s action, wrote Editor O’Dowd, “was proper
and timely ... [and] to be commended.” Segregation extremists,
he thought, would have a hard time labeling this as the action of
“communistic and brainwashed” outsiders.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>On the local level several Methodist churches, generally in the low-country,
have exhibited concern about growing integration support
among church elements. The Hemingway Methodist Church adopted
a statement condemning the Supreme Court ruling as “groundless and
defenseless,” an “improper interpretation of the U. S. Constitution”
and an “unholy invasion of State’s Rights.” To place the white and
colored children together in churches and schools would be “to guarantee
the loss of the sense of biological difference” between the races
which would becloud “our fair land with a mongrelized, second-rate
people cancelling five or more centuries of progress.” Integration was
being accomplished “by propaganda and open advocacy and by the
cunning of idea infiltration.” The Methodists of Hemingway graciously
conceded “the Negro to be human just as the white man, to be
a growing citizen and entitled to equal cultural and economic advantages.”
The “mixing” of the races in church and school, however,
should be “allowed to die and remain so forever.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>The Women’s Society of Christian Service of the Kingstree Methodist
Church insisted that “voluntary separation” of the races was no denial
of the “Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man.” The Society
desired “the advancement of Colored People, but not through the
agency of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.” In the spirit of humility and soul searching, the ladies resolved
that “we desire to continue to work out our way of worshipping
God and in helping our Colored Brethren to do the same for themselves.
All sections of our great country are not the same, and what
is best for one section may not be best for another. We believe that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
in the sight of God we have been working out our problems in a way
acceptable to Him, even though that way be not perfect, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“In some areas of Brotherhood” Church elements favoring integration
were “moving too fast,” continued the Kingstree ladies. “The
coming of the kingdom of God is gradual. We should concentrate on
some of our sins of greed, selfishness, worldliness, etc., before we attempt
too great a change otherwise.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The Manning Methodist Church adopted a resolution which affirmed
belief in the divine origin of man and the principle that all
men “stand on a spiritual equality.” But the Manning Methodists
asserted that “certain social, economic and cultural factors exist
which make it impractical and undesirable that members of the Negro
race be received into and made a part of this congregation.” Should
the South Carolina Methodist Church adopt a policy of racial integration
in its churches, the Manning Methodists would find it “impractical”
to continue connection with that body.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The closeness of the division of opinion amongst South Carolina
Methodists toward the question of church integration was dramatized
at their annual conference in August, 1957, when by a vote of 287-261
it was agreed to permit the denomination’s Negro churches to affiliate
with white Methodists where both agreed. Presiding Bishop Nolan
B. Harmon of Charlotte, North Carolina, was careful to point out that
the new course of policy had nothing to do with integration so far as
individuals were concerned and emphasized that no white church was
obliged to take in anyone. J. C. Holler of Columbia, conference lay
reader and one of the authors of the proposal, declared that “the object
of the plan was to take the race issue out of church law.” It solidified
local control as represented by States Rights, he asserted. But opponents
of the proposal thought differently. A Methodist layman,
D. D. Brown of Hemingway, warned that the plan was “a highway
to integration—a sedative to keep us quiet while the integration plan
is put into force.” Such proposals, he added, played into the hands of
“subversives” and would hasten the “mongrelization” of the races.
The Reverend B. Rhett Turnipseed, a retired clergyman from Greenville,
delivered an impassioned speech against the proposal. At the
time of the unification of the Northern and Southern branches of the
Methodist Church, said the Reverend Turnipseed, he was assured by
two bishops that the question of integration within the church would
not arise. “Brethren,” he declared, “I have kept the faith. My
position hasn’t changed.... It is unfortunate at this time for a denomination
to register itself for a paper like this. This is my swan
song.”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The Baptist Church, the state’s largest denomination, faced, or
more accurately dodged, the race issue at its annual convention in
November, 1954. The convention received a report from its Social
Service Commission urging Baptists to “protect the public school
system and seek to strengthen it in all possible ways.” Noting that
“these are the times that try men’s souls,” the Commission offered
several “guideposts” for Baptists to follow “in this crisis.” “God’s
will” should be “earnestly and prayerfully” sought. White Carolinians
should recognize and “humbly confess” that “in spite of strenuous efforts,
and because of inherited traditions ... adequate educational
opportunities for all our children” had not been provided in the past.
And finally, Baptist action should be based upon the recognition “of
every person as an individual, precious in the eyes of God.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The
Baptists, by receiving a noncommittal statement of principles rather
than in adopting a formal resolution, deftly sidestepped the issue.</p>

<p>Individual Baptist ministers who have spoken out too strongly
against racial segregation have not been immune to pressure. The
most widely publicized incident involved the Reverend G. Jackson
Stafford, pastor of the Batesburg Baptist Church. The Reverend
Stafford’s case was particularly notable because Federal District
Judge George Bell Timmerman, Sr., and his son, Governor George
Bell Timmerman, Jr., were members of his congregation. Judge Timmerman,
who has the hard face of a Puritan elder, was chairman of
the board of deacons. Stafford’s difficulties arose from his vote in
favor of a resolution adopted by the Southern Baptist Convention
endorsing the Supreme Court’s desegregation decision. As a result,
opposition to the minister rapidly developed within the Batesburg
congregation and finally forced his resignation. With rare courage
Stafford refused to renounce his convictions “regarding Christian race
relations.” He charged that his resignation was made necessary by
“several highly placed members of the Batesburg church playing politics”
with religion.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>One of the most notable and quoted addresses against integration by
a minister was delivered before the state Baptist conference on evangelism
in 1956 by the Reverend Dr. W. A. Criswell, president of the
Southern Baptist Convention and pastor of the First Baptist Church
of Dallas, Texas. Dr. Criswell told the Carolina evangelists:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That thing [integration] they are trying to ram down our throats is a thing of
idiocy and foolishness. Any man who says he is altogether desegregated is soft
in the head.</p>

<p>I’m a segregationist when it comes to whom my daughter is going to associate
with. I know some white trash I don’t want my daughter running with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>I’m a segregationist when it comes to the woman I take home at night. I pick
out one, and that one is my wife. We are a segregated family. We don’t invite
everybody to come home with us. If we did, we would not have a home, and the
same thing applies to the church....</p>

<p>Who is stirring up all this stuff? Is it God’s people or is it somebody else? I
happen to know it is somebody else....</p>

<p>This [resistance to desegregation] is part of the ordeal by fire. When a true
minister stands up and is true to God he will have to face these pressures. But
God will not let us down.</p>

<p>They may put your feet to the fire, they can cut off your head, but you can’t
quit. You might want to be dead, but you can’t quit. God has called you and
you must go on.</p>

<p>God help us to be absolutely honest and absolutely fearless in the things we
believe, saying with Martin Luther, “Here I stand, I can do no other.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The day after delivering this oration, the Reverend Doctor Criswell
was invited to address a joint session of the state legislature. In a
speech similar in tone and content to that quoted above, he told the
solons: “Sometimes you can get broad and liberal and it doesn’t matter
... but there are other things that are precious to you such as
whom are you going to marry and who is it that daughter of yours is
going to marry.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>South Carolina Baptists, of course, are affiliated with the Southern
Baptist Convention. The latter was organized in pre-Civil War
days in protest against abolitionist activities of Northern Baptists.
Now one of the nation’s largest denominational groups, the Southern
Baptists have prospered and spread over most of the country. (The
Convention’s 1957 annual meeting, for example, was held in Chicago.)
In recent years the Convention has wandered further and further away
from the “traditional Southern viewpoint” on race relations, especially
since the 1954 Supreme Court decision. The Convention’s action in
forthrightly condemning racial segregation and approving the Court
decision has placed South Carolina Baptists in a quandary. Increasingly
local churches and church groups have been prone to criticize
the national Convention. Shortly after the 1957 Convention’s condemnation
of racial segregation the congregation of the First Baptist
Church of Orangeburg, one of the largest in the state, passed a resolution
offered by its Laymen’s Class which not only criticized the Convention’s
action but declared that “if such practices are continued by
the Southern Baptist Convention it will be for the best interest of the
Baptist Churches of the South to withdraw from the so-called Southern
Baptist Convention and organize an association with churches” which
favor racial segregation. Baptist churches in Olar, Denmark, Manning,
Sumter, Andrews and Branchville adopted similar resolutions.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>South Carolina Episcopalians, who have a central jurisdiction for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
both white and Negro churches, took a wavering stand on the segregation
issue at their 166th annual convention in 1956. By a vote of
94 to 43 they resolved “that there is nothing morally wrong in a voluntary
recognition of racial differences and that voluntary alignments
can be both natural and Christian.” The resolution continued that
it was “the sense of this convention that the integration problem caused
by the Supreme Court decision of 1954 as it applies to the Episcopal
Church should not be characterized as Christian or un-Christian, by
reason of the fact that it is either inter-racial or non-inter-racial. In
such choices, Christians may wisely exercise personal preference.”<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
In adopting this resolution, the convention rejected “by a large majority
in a voice vote” a substitute resolution that would have urged
Episcopalians “to employ at diocesan and parochial levels a strong
degree of calmness and mutual toleration and respect for disagreement.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>The endorsement of voluntary segregation by South Carolina Episcopalians
was scathingly denounced by <cite>The Living Church</cite>, official organ
of the national Protestant Episcopal Church. Comparing the resolution
to the “Aryan Paragraph” which Hitler attempted to force on
all German churches, <cite>The Living Church</cite> declared that “Christians
do not have the right to exercise personal preference to keep other
people out of the church.... It is one thing to be gentle and understanding
about sin; it is another thing to pass resolutions commending
sin on a ‘voluntary’ basis ... open church membership is a first
principle of Christianity. When the church door is closed to a man
because of his race, a sin has been committed. When the church says
that it is all right for this to be done a heresy has been enunciated.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The intensity of opposition of many Episcopalians to integration is
illustrated by a resolution adopted by Episcopal women’s groups of
Sumter, Kingstree, Summerton, Statesburg, and Hagood. In fulfillment
of what they considered to be their duty “to see that those in
high offices in our government are not influenced by Communist doctrines,”
these women, whose mastery of dialectical materialism might
legitimately be questioned, pointed out for all to know that integration
was “a plan of the Communist Party,” a party which acknowledged
“no God except Communism.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>The most overtly pro-segregation religious group in South Carolina
is the Southern Methodist Church, made up of those Methodists who
had refused to agree to the union of the Northern and Southern
branches of Methodism in the 1930’s. Headed in 1955 by the Reverend
Lynn Corbit of Bowman, it is relatively small numerically,
comprising but three conferences in the entire state. In 1955 the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Southern Methodists stated their position in the following terms:
“The Southern Methodist Church stands for continued racial segregation
in the schools, state and federal installations of all kinds, churches,
and all ways of life where it has always been practiced. We wish
further to go on record approving any law-abiding organization that
has as its aims the upholding of segregation in a peaceful manner.”<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>In the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, a member of the Southern Methodists,
S. J. Summers, Jr., of Cameron, described his church as being composed
of “a dauntless group of congregations” which believed “ardently in
the rightness of the Southern Way of Life” and “in the kinship of
mankind under God but with the separations and differences He
Himself instituted and established.” He noted Southern Methodism’s
belief that “the Bible teaches of the decay and ultimate destruction
of nations as the inevitable outcome of decadent faith and mongrelized
bloods.”<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Other denominations have been less outspoken in their views. Presbyterians
simply have continued their policy of segregation in churches
and educational institutions.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> In Summerton, the late Reverend
Henry Rankin, Northern-born and Princeton-educated, was one of the
most active members of the Citizens Council. He sought to impress
Negroes “about the fallacy of trying to get their rights by going to
court.” Other Presbyterian ministers, as will be noted later, have
upheld the Court’s decision as being in line with the basic concepts of
Christianity. An unofficial Lutheran position was presented by H.
Odelle Harman, Lexington School Superintendent and delegate to the
1956 biennial convention of the national Lutheran church. In opposing
a resolution commending integration, Harman told the convention:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Lutheran Church in South Carolina will not integrate. Resolutions of the
kind before us, then, can only serve to hinder the progress and mission of our
great church and undo much of that which has been done in the South to promote
good will and better relations between the two races.... The Christian
church has done much to bring about the confusion and bitterness that we are
experiencing in our racial relations in America today.... I do not believe that
segregation is basically a religious question.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Among religious groups only the Catholics have given endorsement
to the Court decision and to the integration efforts of Negroes. The
missionary South Carolina Catholic Church has held that there is no
segregation before God; therefore, there should be none in the church.
The attitude was given tangible expression by the enrollment of five
Negro and 29 white pupils in St. Anne’s parochial school in Rock Hill
in the 1954-55 term, the only example of school integration in South
Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The Catholics, however, did not desegregate their other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
schools or hospitals. The number of Catholics in the state is small
and only a tiny percentage of their membership is Negro.</p>

<p>Individual ministers frequently address themselves to the race issue.
Several condemn segregation as contrary to Christian teachings concerning
the brotherhood of man, though a much larger number holds
the continuation of segregation desirable. The Reverend Gaston Boyle,
a Presbyterian minister from John’s Island, declared that segregation
was “totally dependent upon the theory of a ‘superior race,’” a concept
which could not “be supported by science, Scripture, or any other
fact” and hence had to be upheld “by half-truths, misquotes and unjust
insinuations.” Dr. Carl Pritchett, pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Anderson, considered desegregation “not a troublesome
problem but a period of painful democratic growth.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The
Reverend Edward L. Byrd, pastor of the First Baptist Church of
Florence, was especially outspoken. The decision of the Supreme
Court, he said, was “fundamentally right” and “doubtless legally correct.”
Answering those who used the Bible as authority for perpetuation
of segregation, he declared that “anyone who seeks shelter
in the Bible for his racial prejudice or his defense of segregation is
walking on thin ice and takes a position that cannot be soundly defended.”
According to the Reverend Byrd “no honest scholar and
no honest minister can find grounds for racial segregation in the Bible.”
The Reverend Fred V. Poag, pastor of the Shandon Presbyterian
Church in Columbia, expressed a similar view: “There is but one
position for a Christian. I believe the Church must be open to all
regardless of color.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Clergymen endorsing segregation find it perfectly compatible with
the fundamental teachings of Christianity. The Reverend J. M. Lane,
pastor of the Tabernacle Baptist Church of Orangeburg, declared, “I
think the Bible teaches segregation and I believe it is the best for
both races. I feel that the work of the Citizens Councils, without
violence and force, is the Christian method of dealing with the move
by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
to force integration in the public schools.”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The Reverend L. B.
McCord of Clarendon feared “mongrelization.” “Some people feel
that segregation is a sin,” he declared. “That isn’t true. Integration
of the races would definitely be sinful.” The Reverend J. J. Patrick,
a retired Methodist minister of Ruffin, stated that the South desired
segregation “because the best white and colored people believe in God
and the Bible.” Writing in the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, he declared,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We were all living in peace and contentment until that old serpent, the devil,
that beguiled Adam and Eve to disobey God and eat the forbidden fruit, led the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
NAACP to scatter propaganda down here and a few (big heads) were beguiled
to follow their teachings....</p>

<p>They [the politicians] with the communists and the NAACP, with some of the
socialist preachers, influenced the U. S. Supreme Court Judges to try to nullify
the Constitution and force us to consolidate the schools and place our little
children in classes with Negro children, contrary to God’s law.</p>

<p>God created the different races and set their bounds and habitation. God
commanded, demanded and taught segregation from the Flood right on down
until the Bible was written....<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The aged and gravel-voiced Dr. Bob Jones, fundamentalist par
excellence, founder of the Bob Jones University in Greenville, and
one of the state’s best known Baptist clergymen, objected to making
segregation a Christian issue when Christianity was not involved.
Like Patrick, he said that any plan for “the intermingling of the races”
was the work “of the devil.” The Christian educator criticized “agitators
from outside the South and demagogue politicians” who were “only
interested in the colored vote.” Christians of both races should “tell
the folks who come in with all this foreign influence to get back where
they came from.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> In like manner, the Reverend Edward B. Guerry,
Rector of the lowcountry St. James’ and St. John’s Episcopal Parishes,
denounced the Supreme Court desegregation decision as “unrealistic,”
“unfortunate,” and conducive to “discord, confusion, and ... sharp
conflict” among the American people. Integration would simply
“deepen” any “sense of inferiority” the Negro might have. The rector
did not believe it was “in keeping with the mind of our Lord Jesus
Christ to force the Kingdom of God on people either by judicial edict,
or legislative action, or ecclesiastical pressure.”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Still another proponent
of segregation, the Reverend E. R. Mason, a retired Columbia
Methodist cleric, decried integrationist assaults on “those institutions
that we must have or we perish,” e.g., “God, your church, home and
schools.” Integration’s “true motive,” he declared, was “infiltrating
the Black race into the White race.”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> The Reverend M. A. Woodson
of the Bethel Baptist Church of Olanta told the Lake City Citizens
Council that the connection between the Communists and the NAACP
had been “conclusively established.” The Citizens Councils, he said,
were the right hands in the fight for constitutional government and
states rights. “We must strive to leave our children a constitutional
form of government and a segregated society that works in harmony.”<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Pro-segregation clergymen have not evolved a systematic theological
basis for defense of their position. Rather each minister has developed
his own. Sermons and statements upholding traditional Southern race
patterns abound with quotations of Biblical authority. In a sermon
that might well have been delivered in the 1850’s in defense of slavery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Dr. E. E. Colvin, pastor of the Immanuel Baptist Church of Orangeburg,
asserted that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... the Old Testament scriptures recognize the existence of things as they
are. We find that also in the New Testament. Jesus did not attempt to change
or reform society in his day by the use of force. There was slavery in his day.
There were many other civil and social ills in his day but never did Jesus attempt
to use force or advocate force. In the centuries that have passed since then the
teachings of Jesus have brought to pass tremendous changes.</p>

<p>Paul sent Onesimus, the slave, back to his former owner, Philemon. Paul didn’t
write to Philemon and say, “You have no right to own this man.” Not at all.
Paul respected the law and the right to private property back in that day.</p>

<p>In the New Testament we find instructions given to slaves and to masters
telling them what to do. “Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the
flesh are your Masters, and ye masters do the same things unto them, and forbear
threatening; knowing that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven,
and there is no respect of persons with Him.” Ephesians 6:5,9.</p>

<p>We find no attempt whatever to overthrow slavery suddenly and by force.
“Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. Wast thou called
being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use
it rather. For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s
freeman: likewise, he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant. Ye were
brought with a price; abide with God.” I Corinthians 7:20-24. The light of the
Scriptures shows that we know by experience, that social changes take time.</p>
</div>

<p>The solution offered by the Doctor was for “our Negro friends” to
“listen to reason and continue the practice of segregation on a voluntary
basis” so that “peace and harmony” might prevail. Should “the
spirit of hatred” induce them to seek integration, they would create a
condition which would “do as much damage in the long run as the War
Between the States did a hundred years ago.”<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>Similar opinions are frequently expressed by others—from both the
clergy and laity. In a letter to the editor of the <cite>Independent</cite>, James
B. Davis of Anderson found scriptural sanction for opposition to integration
in Leviticus 19:19: “Ye shall keep my statutes, Thou shalt
not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind, thou shalt not sow thy
field with a mingled seed.” Citing this authority he wrote: “Oh yes,
we are careful about our pure cattle, poultry, dogs, etc., but we have
advocates in our government who would crossbreed the people, whom
God has put definite marks of color, build and features into, for their
own glory. I have seen a few half breed Negro and white, that is
mingled seed, and God pity an unfortunate child that must face the
world a bastard, with a mingled color in his skin and hair. And he
is a bastard because God has designated nations and languages, and
directed us to go to our father’s people for a husband or wife.” Davis
felt that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution was a “malignant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
growth on a righteous document.” The Constitution should never
have been amended. “Like our Holy Bible, it was good enough”
in its original form.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Another letter writer, Margaret L. Bostwick of Charleston, believed
that a cardinal message of the Bible was “that Israel—ALL Israel,
not just Judah” had been punished and was still being punished “for
having disobeyed the many severe injunctions against the mixing of
races.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Similarly Lawrence Neff of Atlanta noted in the <cite>Morning
News</cite> that “even the very elect may sometimes be deceived, or deceive
themselves.” According to Neff, “Jesus was the most consistent and
the most inflexible segregationist the world has ever known.” As
“proof” he asserted that Jesus, “in commissioning the 12,” had said
to them, “Go not to the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans
enter not....”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Similar statements, indeed, have been legion. An unsigned article
in the <cite>News and Courier</cite> editorial page reminded readers that Jesus
“advised all Christians to seek contentment, rather than advancement,
no matter where Providence had placed them.” Such advice, intimated
the article, might well be followed by Negroes seeking integration.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
Echoing these sentiments and adding a few twists of his own, E.
Robert Rowell, a “Lay Reader” of the Trio Methodist Church, declared
that it was “against God’s divine will for the races to be destroyed
by intermarriage and the bearing of offspring by such marriages.”
In the segregation fight, thought Rowell, the end justified
the means because God’s will was at issue. For this reason he gave
unqualified endorsement to such practices as economic boycotts and
pressures not only “against the Negroes who sign desegregation petitions
or who are members of the NAACP,” but also against “those
who are in sympathy with such people.” He favored refusal by his
church “to receive or support any minister who believes in the false
doctrine of mixing the races.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Others, too, were concerned with showing God’s approval of segregation.
A close study of the Bible, declared the Right Reverend A. S.
Thomas, a retired Episcopal Bishop of Wadmalaw, revealed a “plain
implication” that segregation was not only consistent with brotherly
love but had been ordained by the “appointment of God.” Anyone
who attempted to “facilitate and expedite the amalgamation of the
Negro race with other races” might well be “frustrating a great purpose
of God.” Racial segregation <i lang="la">per se</i> was in no wise unChristian.
Its unChristian aspects were due to “man’s fallen nature, not to
segregation itself.” Integration would please only unnamed leaders
of the nation who wished “to appease atheistic Communism.”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>If God approved segregation, then logically integration was the
work of the devil. Mrs. Edna M. Smith of Charleston blamed the
integration drive with its “fear, confusion and despair” on “Satan”
who was “using all these weapons to gain more power, because he
knows his power is coming to an end and he wants to take all that he
can with him when he goes down into destruction and death.” The
Reverend Paul M. Pridgen, pastor of the First Baptist Church of North
Charleston, announced that “there is no room in Heaven for the
NAACP or any other organization that stirs up race hatred.” The
<cite>News and Courier</cite> took issue with Dr. Norman Vincent Peale’s statement
that heaven was “completely unsegregated.” No one knew “for
sure” what heaven would be like, declared the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, since
“no eye-witness” had returned “to give us the direct word.” However
whites were reassured: “Surely in Heaven there will be no compulsory
sharing by incompatible elements.”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Apparently <em>someone</em> had returned
and had imparted this information to the <cite>News and Courier</cite>.</p>

<p>On occasion, a voice of protest has been raised against the use of
religion as a justification for segregation. The <cite>Morning News</cite> attacked
the statement by a candidate for the State House of Representatives
who had said that if God had intended for the races to be mixed he
would have made all people the same color. “Using the same syllogism,”
said the paper, “it could be argued that if God had intended for
people to wear clothes, people would be born clothed; or if God intended
for people to ride, they would be born with wheels rather than
feet.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> A similar protest came from a Charleston non-conformist.
How long, asked H. B. Clark, would the South fail to see “that any
denial of a fellow human’s rights” constituted “a violation of Christ’s
supreme commandment that we love our neighbor as ourselves?”<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> has leveled some of its most bitter editorial
blasts at those church leaders and groups who have taken a stand
against segregation.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The attitude of this paper is a clear indication
that leading segregation spokesmen recognize in the church a potential
and powerful defaulter from the solid front against desegregation. In
seeking to counteract clerical criticism of segregation, the <cite>News and
Courier</cite> editorials constantly have advised church leaders to steer clear
of such a controversial issue as race segregation. According to these
strictures, segregation is right and desirable, and something for which
no Southerner has to be apologetic. “To upset time-honored balances
that keep the peace” would be both wrong and scandalous. Attempting
to dispose of the moral and psychological implications of racism,
the <cite>News and Courier</cite> insists that Southern whites should entertain
no sense of guilt in connection with segregation policies. “It was God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
who created people with different physical characteristics. Who is to
say that the races He created separate and distinct should now be
scrambled?” If separation on the basis of race were sinful, so was
separation by faiths and creeds. The trouble was that “well-meaning
reformers” were confusing “religious principles with individual social
customs.” “Just as morals are not meant to be observed only on Sunday,
social customs also operate seven days a week.”</p>

<p>The mounting criticism of segregation from non-Southern religious
sources, particularly from the National Council of Churches, is especially
resented in South Carolina. Such ill based criticism, asserted
the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, constituted a part of the general assault on
“the three bulwarks of American decency ... the church, the school
and the home.” Those who engaged in such criticism might themselves
be guilty of religious bigotry. “No church” had “sole possession of
the last word either in religious faith or moral rectitude.” God had
not yet revealed His “precise purpose” in creating people with different
racial characteristics. In more ominous tones, the <cite>News and
Courier</cite> declared “well-meaning” but “misguided” religious leaders
were treading “on dangerous ground in pointing critical fingers at an
entire region’s social structure.” Southerners would “fight and die”
for the freedom “to pick their own associates.”</p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> has suggesed a complete renunciation by the
church of all interest in the race issue. “Those of the white clergy
who have been busily promoting the mixture of the races,” it asserted,
could better serve their congregations by returning “to the religious
and moral aspects of their high calling and leave sociological and
psychological politics to the politicians.” Concurrently, if the Negro
clergy “would devote more time to inspiring their flocks to improve
their morals, and less to inciting them to get in with the white folks,
they would be performing a better service for their people.”</p>

<p>That these attitudes are popular among South Carolinians of all
stations is illustrated by the fact that on frequent occasions they have
been heartily endorsed in letters to the editor. As a case in point
Archibald Rutledge, poet laureate of South Carolina, viewed “with
misgiving the church’s stupid attitude toward segregation.” He regarded
the <cite>News and Courier’s</cite> policy as “so fair, so calm, so profound,”
a policy notable for its “clarity” and “justice.” Rutledge was especially
happy with the paper’s “distinction between religion and ancient
and salutary social customs.” “I KNOW you are right,” he concluded,
“and it is high time that religious leaders realize how wrong, even how
wicked, they are.”<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Concerning the race issue then, South Carolina churches generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
give at least indirect endorsement to a continuation of segregation.
In large part both church organizations and individual ministers attempt
to steer clear of the issue, preferring to concentrate on less
controversial sins.</p>

<h3>A PLACE IN THE SHADE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent10 unindent">We’ve always had a place in the sun down South. Now
I reckon some of us would like a little of the shade
too.—<cite>An Unidentified Negro</cite></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Throughout the segregation-integration controversy white leaders
have rarely attempted to discover what the Negro thinks on the matter.
Instead they have arbitrarily declared that the overwhelming
majority of South Carolina Negroes have no desire for integrated
schools. This claim is made almost without exception. A writer in
the <cite>Morning News</cite> noted that while Southern governors and attorneys
general had held conferences to consider the objectives of Negroes,
they had never called a biracial meeting at which the latter could
voice their aims. On no occasion had white leaders asked Negroes
to state their position; the aspirations of Negroes were always specified
by white men. Such a situation, it was observed, might well result
in “brash action” by “sincere white people, who, alarmed by white
men’s statements of Negro aims,” were girding for war without waiting
to hear the Negroes themselves.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> A perusal of public pronouncements
by Negro leaders and groups reveals that a misconception in regard
to Negro aims and desires exists among the white people of South
Carolina.</p>

<p>The goal sought by the overwhelming majority of South Carolina
Negro leaders is an immediate end to legal segregation. They recognize
that for many years to come <i lang="la">de facto</i> segregation will continue to
exist. But on the point of legally enforced segregation, there is no
compromise. Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, a native South Carolinian and
president of Morehouse College in Atlanta, told a meeting of the
Florence County NAACP that the immediate concern of the Negro
was not for integration but desegregation. Desegregation, he said,
meant “to destroy segregation based on law.” Likewise A. J. Clement,
Jr., president of the Charleston County NAACP chapter, said South
Carolina Negroes wished an opportunity to make their “best contribution”
to the development of the state, an objective that could be
realized only by ending segregation.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>At this point a more complete picture of the aims and aspirations
of South Carolina Negroes is in order. As already has been noted,
white political leaders constantly have stated that the majority of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
state’s Negroes oppose desegregation. Only on occasion is it acknowledged
that the Negro might, after all, want desegregation. The <cite>News
and Courier</cite> believed that “the average Southern Negro” would accept
as much mingling “as the white man would allow.” It did not think,
though, that the Negro was “willing to risk a great deal to attain it.”
This “moderate attitude” by Negroes was in keeping with “good
citizenship as well as good race relations.” The recognition of “conditions
as they exist,” according to the Charleston paper, should be
neither “humiliating nor degrading for Negroes.” Writing in <cite>Harper’s</cite>
in early 1956, Thomas R. Waring, editor of the <cite>News and Courier</cite>,
admitted that “it would not be hard to believe that, given a choice,
a Negro naturally would prefer all restrictions to be removed.” But
“a firm and positive stand by people everywhere,” he held, would put
an end to “the race agitation that has plagued our country these last
several years.”<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>A more positive statement of this attitude was made by W. D.
Workman, Jr., the <cite>News and Courier</cite> correspondent. Writing in late
1955, he observed that too many white South Carolinians were laboring
“under the dangerous delusion that Negroes of the state do not
want integration.” In truth, he maintained, “a large percentage” of
Negroes “and an even greater percentage of their leaders very definitely
do want integration of the races, and as soon as possible.” The
failure of the state’s leadership to recognize this situation involved
“the tactical error—which could prove disastrous—of underestimating
the enemy.” Assessing the extent to which Negroes desired integration,
Workman noted that educational, religious and civic leaders
seemed overwhelmingly “determined to press for integration.” He reported
a division amongst Negroes with “some genuinely and sincerely”
opposing any integration and others who doubted the practicability
of the “current rate” of integration. But among Negro leaders he
found “increasingly open and avowed agitation for integration.”<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> In
substantial agreement, the <cite>Record</cite> termed the belief that a majority
of Negroes favored segregation a “head-in-the-sand theory.”<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>It is hardly possible to evaluate with exactness, of course, the attitude
of the rank and file of South Carolina Negroes toward segregation.
In early 1956 the Gallup Poll asked people throughout the
country their opinion on the Supreme Court decision. No results on
a statewide basis were announced; however, the poll indicated that 53
percent of Southern Negroes (13 states) approved the decision while
36 percent opposed it and 11 percent were undecided. For comparison
only 16 percent of Southern whites approved the decision, 80 percent
disapproved, and four percent were undecided.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The vehement opposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
of Southern whites to integration, reported the Gallup organization,
caused many Negroes “to view with misgivings the possible
repercussions” of race mixing. However, the report noted “a common
desire” on the part of Southern Negroes “to give their children the
best possible education and obtain for their race the treatment which
they consider to be in keeping with the ‘American way of life.’” In
a survey of the status of race relations in South Carolina in early 1956,
the <cite>New York Times</cite> noted that, while Negroes were “more cautious”
in expressing views than whites, nonetheless, there was “little or no
question that literate, articulate Negroes generally” desired an end
of legal segregation. These groups, reported the <cite>Times</cite>, resented being
“officially classed” as “an inferior race and as second class citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Despite an understandable reluctance of Negroes to express themselves
on segregation, news reporters on occasion have been able to
obtain revealing statements. In the summer of 1956 an Associated
Press writer, interviewing Negroes in Clarendon County, sought the
opinions of the family of William Hilton, a tenant farmer. Several of
Hilton’s 13 children spoke out forthrightly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I’d like to go to school with white children, said Henrietta Hilton, 13. I just
don’t like to segregate myself because of my color or hair. I’d like to be able to
pick friends on another basis. I think I’d enjoy being friends with some white
girls. Maybe they’d enjoy being friends with me.</p>

<p>I never wished I was white, said Morgan Hilton, 16. I just wished many times
I was treated like the whites.</p>

<p>In the movies, said Leroy Hilton, 19, we got to go up to “Buzzards Roost”
(the Jim Crow Balcony). When there’s a good picture, we’ll be standing up
there even though there’s empty seats downstairs. My feeling is we pay as much,
we ought to be able to sit anywhere. Every time I go, I get mad, but I don’t
say anything.</p>

<p>I feel insulted every time I got to sit in the back of a Jim Crow bus, said
Henrietta. I feel insulted every time I go into the drugstore for ice cream or
a soda. All the booths are for whites. We got to have our ice cream out on the
hot street. I just wonder what makes them think they’re superior. Sometimes,
you walk down the street and white people just look at you scornful. You can
feel it.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Statements made by individual Negro leaders and resolutions adopted
by various Negro groups reveal a willingness of Negroes generally to
follow anti-segregationist leaders. The Progressive Democratic Party,
the state’s leading Negro political group, stated that the question
was no longer segregation or integration but rather “how best” to
accomplish desegregation. The party proposed creation of an inter-racial
commission to handle such problems as would arise during the
period of integration. The Palmetto Education Association, representing
approximately 7,000 Negro public school teachers, adopted a resolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
in 1955 hailing the Supreme Court decision of May 17, 1954,
as “consistent with the Association’s belief” in democracy. The Association
offered to cooperate in “discussing, outlining, and implementing
plans for universal public education” in the state “within the
framework of the recent ruling of the United States Supreme Court.”<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
The Association’s stand is particularly noteworthy since there is general
agreement that many Negro teachers would be eased out of their
jobs should integrated schools become an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>The Richland County Chapter of the South Carolina Citizens Committee
(Negro), in an unusually strong statement, declared that it
stood “solidly for the respect and observance of all laws.” The chapter
wished it “clearly understood” that this included the Supreme
Court decision of May 17, 1954. “To circumvent or to defy the law
is rebellion and to join others in so doing is criminal conspiracy which
could lead to anarchy.” The chapter concluded that the Negro’s
struggle was “neither temporary nor futile” since its ultimate objective
was “the proper evaluation of each individual and the proper
regard for human dignity.” The Clarendon County Civic League,
which backed the school suit, attacked segregation as “un-Christian,
undemocratic, unscientific, and asinine.” Statements to the effect
that Negroes favored segregation, according to the League, revealed
“a deep-seated racial prejudice that has warped the intellect, the
sensibilities and the wills” of white people. According to State NAACP
president James M. Hinton, “Negro parents only want their children
taught by competent teachers and in integrated schools, where children
of both races can learn to study and learn to live as citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Opposition to school integration has arisen from isolated Negro
individuals and groups. More than 100 “patrons” of a Negro school
in Mullins signed a petition urging continuation of segregation and
“opposing integration of the Caucasian and Negro schools.” A similar
petition was signed by Negro parents in North Augusta. This group
feared integration “might disrupt progress now being made” in the
Negro school program. A Negro school principal in Ehrhardt, in
Bamberg County, thought integration would result in Negro teachers
and pupils being “thrust into a most peculiar situation” which would
be beset “with many perplexing problems and grave consequences.”
Educational opportunities of Negro children under integration, he
feared, would “suffer for the next 50 years.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> A Negro delegate to
the Horry County Democratic Convention said that he wanted his
children “to go to as good a school as any man’s children,” but “to
the same school they go to now.” Dr. Ben J. Armstrong, prominent
Mullins Negro, believed it would take “a thousand years” for the races<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
to get ready for desegregation. The Reverend Webster McClary, a
“preacher” from Kingstree, praised the Citizens Councils as being
composed of “smart steady men” who “mean business” and declared
that Negroes did not desire mixed schools any more than whites.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I can say this to any Negro who has it sticking in his craw that he can’t be
happy without trying mixed schools [said McClary]. All you have to do to
get your heart’s desire is buy a ticket to Philly or other points North where they
are already mixed. Nobody has to tell you that colored children don’t learn
books as fast as whites. But see for yourself how pitiful your big colored children
will look in the same grades with smaller white children. Have you got enough
money to dress your brood in clothes they won’t be ashamed of? Go ahead and
try it if you must. But don’t be fool enough to slam the door in your white
friends’ faces before you go. You might want to come back like I did after I
lived up there awhile. How if you came home and find the door locked?—Will
the NAACP give you a handout? Laugh, folks, laugh.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> considered McClary’s statement to be “moderate
in tone and sensible in approach.” The <cite>Independent</cite> thought it
“timely advice” for Negroes. A letter to the editor of the <cite>News and
Courier</cite> nominated McClary for the Pulitzer Prize “for the most
enlightening and constructive” comment on the race problem “made
to date.” The same writer opined that McClary and eight other men
“equally as intelligent” should be appointed to the United States Supreme
Court.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Pro-segregation statements by Negro leaders have become less frequently
heard as attitudes toward the problem have hardened on both
sides. Pressure for conformity has worked within both the Negro and
white communities, though probably less effectively so among Negroes.</p>

<p>The attitude of Negro church groups is of especial significance in
light of the church’s undeniably great influence within the Negro
community. The number of ministers and prominent laymen among
Negro improvement and advancement groups is unusually high. Statewide
Negro church associations almost without exception have endorsed
the Court decision and have called for the ending of racial
segregation. The Progressive Democratic Party claimed that as early
as 1951 “religious denominations and groups administering to more
than 600,000 of the state’s 850,000 colored citizens” made voluntary
statements and declarations which urged the removal of racial segregation
in public places. The South Carolina conference of the Central
(Negro) Jurisdiction of the Methodist Church, in endorsing the struggle
of the Negro for equality of treatment, approved all organizations
which sought “the full participation of all American citizens in the
responsibilities and privileges of this nation.” Bishop Frank Madison
Reid expressed the attitude of the state’s African Methodist Episcopal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
Church in late 1955. In suspending the Reverend James Vanwright
for opposing integration and the court decision, Bishop Reid asserted:
“No minister in our church can openly declare or write anything that
attacks the scriptural belief in the equality of all men.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Dr. G. G.
Daniels, president of the Negro Baptist State Convention, in supporting
efforts to end all legal racial discriminations, stated that the Negro
was seeking only those human rights guaranteed by the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
A manifesto of the Columbia Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance,
a Negro group, declared that there could be “no first-class citizenship
in a segregated society.” Full participation of the Negro in the life
of South Carolina would come only after the removal of such barriers
as “racial segregation, discrimination, Jim Crowism and economic
pressure.” The Alliance recognized the difficulties involved in the
process of desegregation. “Things cannot be changed overnight,” the
Reverend J. Arthur Holmes, Alliance president, told this organization
in 1956.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>The attitude of individual Negro ministers conforms to the same
general pattern. The Reverend William L. Wilson, pastor of a Spartanburg
Baptist Church, told a newspaper reporter that he was sometimes
“ashamed” of his white colleagues. “They tell me privately,”
he said, “that segregation is wrong, but they will say nothing publicly.”
The Reverend Giles G. Brown, a Methodist Minister of Charleston,
referring to proposals for church integration, said that there was only
“one human family.” The brotherhood of that family was ordained
by God. Any movement that furthered this brotherhood would eventually
succeed but in some areas this would come only after a “long,
long time.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>Negro leaders were restrained in commenting on the Court decision.
James M. Hinton said that “Negroes, though happy,” were “most
mindful of the seriousness of the decision” and would cooperate fully
with state leaders in its implementation. “There is no place in a
democracy for segregation,” he declared. Bishop Reid called for “a
special day of thanksgiving at this hour when the Supreme Court has
answered the challenge and call of democracy.”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>A small minority of Negro religious spokesmen opposed the decision.
The Reverend Hydrick Strobel of St. George, a black-belt
town, urged his congregation to “be well pleased and thank God for
equal but separate schools for our colored children, where they can
learn to take pride in their own race, instead of being ashamed of it.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>A staff writer for the <cite>Record</cite>, analyzing the reaction of Clarendon
County Negroes to the decision, stated that “there is not much rejoicing,
even among the colored people of this district, over the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
their case has turned out. They hold their heads a little higher and
they seem to have a little more confidence in themselves, but they are
concerned about the future of the schools.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> In like manner an Associated
Press writer noted the difficulty of determining the opinion of
the majority of Clarendon Negroes. “Some say that they want segregation
to continue as long as facilities are equal,” he reported. “Some
are against it. Many won’t say either way.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>White South Carolinians in maintaining that Negroes desire segregation,
customarily quote Negro “hands,” domestic servants or others
who had said they favored segregation. In evaluating these pro-segregation
statements by Negroes, the whites rarely distinguish between
the uneducated, economically dependent Negro and recognized
Negro leadership. Such a mistake results naturally from the Booker
T. Washington tradition that the Southern white man is the only true
friend of the Negro and has always stood ready to give him assistance
and advice in meeting the challenges of the white man’s civilization.
Whereas Yankees might mouth pious platitudes about all men being
created equal and having equal rights, the Southerner is the true benefactor
of the Negro on the individual level.</p>

<p>Indications are that in some quarters this attitude is changing as
a result of the segregation controversy. James M. Hinton spoke of
the rise of a “new Negro” in the South, one whom “traditional” Southerners
had difficulty in understanding. A few white spokesmen have
admitted that the “new Negro” was difficult to comprehend. W. D.
Workman, Jr., spoke of the “incapacity of the white man to fathom
the thinking of the Negro.” In a similar vein the <cite>Record</cite> editorially
observed that “no white person can know what the Negroes are thinking.
For ordinarily a Negro tells a white man in the South what he
thinks that white person wishes to hear. It may not be and frequently
is not what the Negro actually thinks.”<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Despite such evidence the state’s political leaders continue to assert
that Negroes favor the <i lang="la">status quo</i>. They possess, in short, a superabundance
of William James’s “will to believe.” In his inaugural address,
Governor Timmerman asserted that “most Negro parents” did
not want their children “to mix with large groups of white children.”
Lieutenant Governor E. F. Hollings, characterizing segregation as a
“natural thing,” maintained that “a majority of Negroes” were no
more enthusiastic about mixed schools than white persons. Senator
Marion Gressette told a Bamberg audience that “thousands of Negroes”
were fighting with the whites to preserve segregation.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Newspaper editorialists also generally agree that the majority of
Negroes oppose integration. The <cite>News and Courier</cite> thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
“except for the NAACP and a few other zealots,” Negroes were not
willing “to disrupt harmonious race relations for a goal that many of
them view with indifference.” The <cite>Independent</cite> believed public school
integration was opposed “not only by white people but by thinking
Negro leaders and the patrons of Negro schools.” The <cite>Morning News</cite>,
after James A. Rogers replaced Jack H. O’Dowd as editor in August,
1956, felt that the majority of Negroes did not regard “with sympathy
the efforts of some of their contemporaries to force an unnatural mixing
of the races which would create unbearable tensions and inequalities.”<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>White spokesmen only rarely can see any reason for the Negro’s
“agitation” for the abolition of segregation. Under segregation, said
the <cite>Morning News</cite>, the Negro had “opportunities for racial development
unparalleled anywhere else in this country.” Segregation was
“not an evil scheme” to keep the Negro in subjection but a high road
along which he could achieve “maximum development in an atmosphere
without tension or ill-will.” An excellent example of the “separate-but-equal”
argument appears in the following editorial statement
from the <cite>Morning News</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We believe that an integrated school system would deepen the Negro’s inferiority
complex, that it would magnify his sense of being a second class citizen,
that he would not develop normally under the tensions and inequalities of
integration. We believe that his finest opportunities are with equal segregated
facilities. We believe that he is entitled to equal facilities, that he, like his
white brother, is entitled to all the benefits of being an American citizen, but for
the sake of his race, its potential, its integrity, its development, he should demand
segregation in the public schools as offering the only normal, natural atmosphere
in which to work for maximum racial development. Furthermore, we believe
that the majority of Negroes themselves who view the problem objectively are
of the same opinion.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Segregation by such reasoning is less a benefit for the white than for
the Negro.</p>

<p>Segregationists seem totally unable to understand the failure of
Negro leaders to support the <i lang="la">status quo</i>. “The finest thing that could
happen to the Negro race,” declared the <cite>Morning News</cite>, “would be
the emergence of leadership that would crusade for voluntary segregation
with the same vigor and persistence that the NAACP has crusaded
for integration.”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> That such leadership has not been forthcoming
allegedly has been due to the “reign of terror” which the NAACP
has instigated against Negro moderates. Lowcountry Negroes, like
lowcountry whites, noted the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, were “largely conservative,”
an attitude expressed in their “reluctance to agitate for racial
change.” These moderates were loath to speak out because they would
be “penalized by the extremists.” Although such moderates had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
“strong support” among Negroes in the state, they were largely “silent.”
Negroes who spoke out in favor of segregation, concluded the <cite>News
and Courier</cite>, were the “truly heroic” element in the segregation controversy.
“It would be well,” Senator Gressette said, “for us to encourage
the members of the Negro race with these [pro-segregation]
views,” so that they in turn could “discourage the few whites and colored,
from within and without the state,” who were advocating integration.
State Senator Marshall Williams would extend such encouragement
to all Negroes. “We should talk with the colored people we
employ, and can influence,” he said, “give them the benefit of what
we know, explain how they are being duped by the NAACP and other
outsiders and convince them that it would be better to live at peace
among their white neighbors in a segregated society.” White advice,
then, is for the Negro to return to the “sound counsel” of Booker T.
Washington.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>White leaders are certain that they and not the Negroes themselves
best realize the latter’s true needs. “Unless the Negroes come to their
senses and cast out the false leaders,” warned the <cite>News and Courier</cite>,
they might find that they had been led “down a primrose path to
misery and disaster.” “Respectable Southern white people” are the
Negro’s best friends.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Running concurrently with this refrain is the
frequently stated belief that nowhere on earth have Negroes been so
fortunate as in the South. “Segregation has been a success,” especially
from the standpoint of the Negro, proclaimed Dr. E. E. Colvin,
a white Baptist minister of Orangeburg.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The South had “none of the
‘isms’ and tensions of the Northern cities,” asserted Gilbert Wilkes of
Mt. Pleasant in a letter to the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, echoing the century
old philosophy of George Fitzhugh and John C. Calhoun. “As far
as race relations go,” the Negro lived “a much freer and happier life”
in the South. Another letter writer, Alford W. Atkins of Charleston,
stated that in the North in contrast to the South, one did not see among
Negroes “the smiling or solemn dark faces ... filled with content or
at least joy in living and the happiness that comes from it.” Negroes
in the North “looked strained and dissatisfied with life.” The <cite>News
and Courier</cite> said that “apparently” integration was not bringing happiness
to Northern Negroes. Instead “contentment, freedom from worry
and a pleasant disposition” which have been the “prize possessions”
of Southern Negroes disappeared with the end of segregation.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>As will be shown subsequently in greater detail, the segregation
controversy has played a major role in state politics in the period
following the May 17, 1954, ruling by the Supreme Court. The constant
political concern with the subject explains in part the inability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
of the two sides to get together and calmly work out a mutually agreeable
<i lang="la">modus vivendi</i>. Negro leaders see politicians using the issue as
a political football for personal benefit. Contributing to this situation
has been the failure of the Negroes to register and vote in sufficiently
large numbers to cause politicians to fear their influence at the
polls. Absence of an effective political pressure action group has not
helped the Negroes. The Progressive Democratic Party, the only real
Negro political organization in the state, has been practically moribund
from 1948 to 1958. Efforts of Negro political spokesmen have been
hampered because a large majority of the state’s Negroes are ideologically
Democrats in the national sense while Negro leaders receive
no consideration from state Democratic leaders.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Negroes have attempted to make the pressure of their votes felt in
the state and not without some success in presidential elections. On
the state and local levels, however, they are completely frustrated.
They can not, for example, find candidates who will campaign on even
a “moderate” platform with regard to the race issue. Consequently
the Negro has only the choice of the lesser of several evils. The Negro
vote, moreover, is most ineffective in areas where it is potentially the
strongest, that is in heavily Negro populated low country counties.
In such counties the number of Negro voters was less than in those
where the Negro population was lower percentagewise.</p>

<p>Leading Negro political spokesmen have been John H. McCray,
chairman of the Progressive Democratic Party, and the Reverend
James M. Hinton, president of the state NAACP. McCray’s party
sent a delegation to the national Democratic convention in 1956 to
challenge the regular slate headed by Governor Timmerman. One of
its purposes was to secure official recognition by the convention in the
event the regular delegation walked out over the civil rights issue.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
The presence of the Negro group probably had little if any influence
on the decision of the regulars to remain in the convention.</p>

<p>The actual influence of the Negro vote in the state is difficult to
assess. Until 1958 voter registration has omitted any mention of race
and ballots by whites and Negroes have not been cast separately.
Also various groups, white and Negro, have made claims and counterclaims
for political purposes. McCray maintained his party delivered
85,000 to 95,000 votes to the Democratic Party nominee in 1952 and
was thus responsible for the Democratic victory. A similar claim was
made for 1956. Anti-Negro politicians, especially among the Independents
of 1956, agreed with these claims. They hoped thereby to
stigmatize the Democratic Party.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>In late 1954 the Palmetto State Voters Association was formed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
organize Negro voters for the purpose of electing to public office candidates
sympathetic to the Negro. It has had little, if any, success,
in part because many of the leaders of other groups, including the
NAACP, oppose isolating Negro voters in a separate group. Such
action, it is argued, is inconsistent with the professed aim of the Negro
for full integration into the state’s political activities. “Racial bloc
voting,” said A. J. Clement, Jr., was “out of order, out of style” and
did not provide the advantage of a system that was interested in the
whole as against a particular part.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>The organization primarily responsible for the giant steps taken
by Negroes toward the goal of full participation in the responsibilities
and benefits of American citizenship is the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People. The South Carolina conference
has chapters scattered throughout the state with headquarters in Columbia.
The state organization, headed by the Reverend James M.
Hinton, claimed 22,000 members in South Carolina in early 1956.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
Though membership rolls are not made public, it would appear that
the major portion of NAACP spokesmen are from middle class and
professional groups. A disproportionate number of the organization’s
leaders are ministers. The NAACP generally represents the best in
the state’s Negro leadership. The state conference, though virtually
autonomous, works closely with the national headquarters in seeking
to end all racial discriminations based on law. According to the official
Civil Rights Handbook published by the national headquarters,
the NAACP is “not a legal aid society” for supplying assistance to
every needy colored person. Its intervention in legal suits is limited
to three categories: (1) Legal defense of innocent colored persons
who are victims of injustice solely because of race, (2) Assistance in
legal cases involving colored persons where fundamental civil or constitutional
rights are involved, and (3) Affirmative legal action to
establish principles of law of benefit to colored persons generally.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Working within these boundaries and in conjunction with the national
headquarters, the state conference has secured several notable
victories, the most spectacular being the Clarendon County school case.
The NAACP also assisted in the cases which resulted in pay equalization
for white and Negro school teachers and in the destruction of the
white primary in South Carolina. In other less publicized cases assistance
has also been given. “The litigious NAACP,” the <cite>Record</cite>
complained, “has been behind every one of the suits to mix the races
in the public schools, the colleges and universities, in transportation and
in state parks and other recreation areas.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>The degree to which South Carolina Negroes agree with the NAACP<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
and its aims and objectives is evidenced by the widespread support
given the drive to end segregation by church, professional and other
groups. Many organizations have gone on record as supporting an
end to segregation without giving a specific endorsement to the NAACP.
But the general public directly associates the NAACP with leadership
in this fight. Typical of the expressions of support given the NAACP
was the resolution adopted by a portion of the student body and faculty
of the Negro college at Orangeburg when the state legislators were
planning an investigation of NAACP activities at the institution. The
NAACP was regarded “as simply one organization” which gave “vitality”
to the furtherance of the constitutional rights of the Negro.
The students and teachers disavowed “any knowledge of information
that that organization represents any more than the maintenance of
law and order in the determination of and in the protection of the
constitutional rights involved.”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>The NAACP is not without Negro opponents in the state. One of
the most outspoken is P. B. Mdodana, a school principal at McBee.
Mdodana, a native of South Africa, has spent most of his life in the
United States. He charged that Negroes were “losing their Constitutional
rights to a loud-speaking, scheming minority” which did
not hesitate to employ coercion to achieve its “scheming and radical
demands.” No exponent of logical consistency, Mdodana praised
passage of a state law which forbade employment by state or local
governments to members of the NAACP. Another NAACP opponent
is George A. Elmore, whose lawsuits resulted in the ending of the
white primary in the state. Significantly Elmore had broken with
the NAACP after his failure to secure an office with the organization.
He maintained that the NAACP was “interested in the little
man only when the little man could be used to serve the organization’s
interest.” On other occasions, said the frustrated Elmore, the association
was concerned “only with college people and ‘big shots.’”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Following the Supreme Court decision in the Clarendon case, the
NAACP was obliged to consider formulation of a program that would
not compromise the Negro’s legal position and yet take cognizance
of the intransigence of white Southerners. No concrete policy could
be set forth until the Supreme Court handed down its implementing
decree and the district court subsequently applied it to the Clarendon
case. These actions were taken in May and July, 1955. Consequently
not until late summer of that year did the NAACP begin sponsoring
such “overt acts” as petitions for the ending of school segregation.</p>

<p>Shortly after the original Court ruling, Hinton announced that the
NAACP would exhaust “local remedies” before again resorting to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
courts.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Petitions filed with school officials at the time of the original
ruling would be held in abeyance until announcement of the Court’s
implementation policy. Meantime the NAACP concentrated on a
program, notable for its utter and complete failure, of inducing state
political leaders voluntarily to accept both the letter and spirit of the
decision. National NAACP Chairman Dr. Channing H. Tobias called
on Governor Byrnes to accept his “responsibility of influencing implementation”
of the decision “in the light of the present international
situation, rather than in the light of local prejudice or political expediency.”
“The pioneer role of our Association in South Carolina,”
he continued, had “focused world attention upon this state.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The
plea of Dr. Tobias fell on stone deaf ears.</p>

<p>Following the district court ruling in July, 1955, enjoining Clarendon
and Summerton school officials from refusing admission of any
pupil to a school solely on the basis of race, the NAACP and Negro
parents were faced with a difficult decision. A meeting of Negroes,
attended by Thurgood Marshall, was held in Clarendon. Though not
indicating his future course of action, Marshall was given a rousing
vote of confidence by “virtually 100 percent” of those present. With
the district court ruling on their side, the next move was up to the
Negro leaders. Clarendon school authorities bluntly stated that under
no conditions would the schools be kept open if a single Negro pupil
were admitted to white classrooms. In light of this threat, Negro
leaders and parents decided to postpone further action. Negro
students would be the biggest losers should the schools be closed.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>In the summer of 1955 the NAACP began sponsoring a number of
petitions asking local school boards to “reorganize the public schools”
on a “non-discriminatory basis.” The petitions were scattered throughout
the state. Most were similarly worded, indicating that the movement
had statewide direction. White South Carolinians reacted to
these petitions by the organization of Citizens Councils.</p>

<p>The petition presented the Florence County Board of Education
was typical. Signed by twenty-four Negro parents, it reminded school
authorities of the Court rulings of May 17, 1954, and May 31, 1955,
and asked that Florence school officials “take immediate steps to
reorganize the public schools” on a “non-discriminatory basis.” Pupils
could no longer be “denied admission to any school solely because
of race and color,” asserted the petitioners. “The time for delay,
evasion or procrastination” was past. School officials were “duty
bound to take immediate concrete steps leading to early elimination
of segregation in the public schools.” They were assured of the willingness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
of Negro parents “to serve in any way ... to aid ... in dealing
with this question.”<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>These petitions invoked the displeasure of many moderate whites
and the wrath of extremists. The <cite>Morning News</cite>, one of the few South
Carolina papers then not unsympathetic to the Negro, thought the
petitions “most unfortunate” following as they did “so closely on the
heels of the Supreme Court’s integration decree.” Their presentation
was a “shock” to South Carolina. The <cite>News and Courier</cite> asked:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Who are these people [who signed the petition]? How many of them have
children in the public schools? Who persuaded them to sign? (Some people
can be persuaded to sign a petition for almost anything.) Do they realize what
they are signing? Do they understand that they may be helping to break down
the public school system and even friendly race relations?</p>

<p>White citizens should study carefully the list of names in the newspapers.
If they are acquainted with any of the Negro signers, they might ask them some
of the questions propounded here and others of their own. These are legitimate
questions. Anyone seeking to upset conditions as they are should be willing
to explain his reasons....</p>

<p>White people have been educating Negroes for centuries. They now need to
undertake a new educational program in race relations. The right of petition
belongs to Negroes as to any citizens. So does the right to question the wisdom
of the petitioners. If enough white people take it on themselves to talk with
Negroes about these matters, the result may be better understanding on the part
of both races.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>As a consequence of economic pressures brought to bear against the
petitioners by the Citizens Councils, many of the former asked that
their names be withdrawn. They frequently maintained that their
signatures had been obtained through misrepresentation. Usually
they claimed they did not realize that the petitions were asking for
integration. Some said they had understood the petitions as simply
requesting interracial talks on the subject of integration. The number
of those asking their names be withdrawn was large, in some cases
more than half the number of signers. In one case, Elloree, fourteen
of the original seventeen signers asked that their names be struck from
the list.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>The NAACP recognized this problem and also the fact that for the
time being little could be done about it. “Names being struck from
petitions” was understandable, said Roy Wilkins, executive secretary
of the NAACP. He did not believe, however, that the signers failed
to realize what their signatures meant. He blamed withdrawals on
“pressures” operating on the Negro. The Sumter chapter of the
NAACP gave a similar explanation for the withdrawal of several
signers of a local petition. The signers “knew very well the content
and intent of these petitions,” said a statement issued by the chapter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
No “coercion, persuasion or pressure” had been used to secure signatures.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>As of the early spring of 1958 no school board has acted favorably on
a petition for school integration and no Negro petitioner has resorted
to the courts to secure affirmative action.</p>

<p>The NAACP has born the brunt of the opposition to the desegregation
drive. Until white South Carolina recognized the extent of the
“threat” represented by the NAACP, its opposition to the organization
had not been particularly bitter. The hardening of attitudes was the
result of the NAACP’s increased pressure for racial integration and
occurred relatively late. For instance, when the NAACP was holding
its annual conference at Charleston in 1953, J. Walker Evans, executive
vice-president of the Charleston Chamber of Commerce, was
“happy to extend a cordial and sincere welcome” to the organization
and hoped that its deliberations would be “fruitful,” “pleasant,” and
“most profitable.”<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> But after the segregation decision all this changed.
Even white “moderates” felt obliged to deprecate the NAACP. Editor
O’Dowd of the <cite>Morning News</cite>, who had frequently defended the
association against irresponsible charges such as communist-front
action, stated that the organization was doing nothing more than “paying
lipservice to the idea of Negro advancement.”<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The attack on the NAACP has taken many different forms but
basically the association is pictured as a radical organization responsible
for the “climate of recalcitrance” in the South by insisting on its
“pound of flesh” and refusing to adopt a “moderate” attitude. The
NAACP refused to “barter or compromise,” complained the <cite>Morning
News</cite>, and instead had adopted a program of “absolutism” which
only made the problem more difficult. New assaults by the NAACP
against “the traditional citadels of Southern society,” the Florence
paper asserted, were “lacking in good sense and good taste.” According
to the <cite>Independent</cite>, “responsible Negroes” knew that NAACP’s
“radical agitators” had done “far more harm than good” in the school
crisis. The <cite>Record</cite> argued that the NAACP was acting “neither
wisely nor tolerantly, preferring neither understanding nor cooperation.”<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
The same papers choose to overlook the fact that the dominant
white community has offered no basis for compromise or conciliation
within terms of the Supreme Court decision.</p>

<p>As a result of the NAACP’s “radical” stand, i.e., its refusal to accept
segregation indefinitely, an attack has been made on all fronts to discredit
the organization in the eyes of both whites and Negroes. The
goal is to create an atmosphere in which any program, policy or pronouncement
by the association will be condemned automatically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
without regard to its merit. “If there’s one thing against our way of
life in the South,” announced Lieutenant Governor Hollings, “it’s the
NAACP. And if the U. S. Supreme Court can declare certain organizations
as subversive, I believe South Carolina can declare the NAACP
both subversive and illegal.” In the Lieutenant Governor’s home
town the <cite>News and Courier</cite> proclaimed that the NAACP was “not
genuinely devoted to the advancement of the colored people,” but
rather ignored the real need of the Negro in its “search for headlines
and racial martyrs.” The <cite>News and Courier</cite> believed that the association
was not interested in Negro “rights” but “that whites be forced
to associate with Negroes.”<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The paper regretted that so many
Negroes would swallow the “unwholesome and impractical poisons”
of the NAACP. The <cite>Record</cite> declared the Association was interested
in cases of violence against Southern Negroes solely for their fund
raising value. “The NAACP would have been disappointed” if the
slayers of Emmett Till had been brought to justice because the case
provided the occasion for the raising of vast funds. The Reverend
E. R. Mason, a retired officer and minister of the white South Carolina
Methodist Church, termed the NAACP a “militant” and “vicious”
minority group interested only in the “prominence of the front page
and money.”<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>A favorite tactic in this campaign of vilification is to equate the
NAACP’s desegregation aims with the communist conspiracy against
the United States. Attorney General T. C. Callison told the Columbia
Rotary Club that the NAACP was led by “meddlers” who were “playing
directly into the hands of Communism.”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The leadership of the
Citizens Councils has given especially strong emphasis to this phase
of the attack. Henry E. Davis, a Florence attorney, speaking at the
organizational meeting of the Lake City Citizens Council, announced
that “the NAACP is financed by Russia.” On another occasion he
indulged in anti-Semitism, a tendency which has become increasingly
open in the Citizens Council movement. Davis referred to the
NAACP as “a communist-front organ,” which was “in reality a Jewish
organization with financial backing from the Communists” purporting
“to aid the advancement of the Negro while stirring up disorder.”
G. L. Ivey, a leader of several white supremacy groups in Florence,
including the Citizens Council, described the NAACP as “the radical
Negro organization dominated by communist-front leaders.”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Stanley
F. Morse, one of Ivey’s many Charleston counterparts, noted that
the objectives of the NAACP coincided “strangely with the aims of
the American communist party.” He declared that the policies of
the NAACP were “dictated by white radicals rather than Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
patriots.” In 1954 the bellwether <cite>News and Courier</cite> did not believe
the “aggressive race movement among Negroes” was communist-dominated.
But a year later, the same paper intimated to its readers:
“We believe the NAACP represents only a small but belligerent group
of people. (In Russia only a small number of Russians belong to
the Communist Party yet they rule the rest.) We aren’t saying the
NAACP is Communistic. We are only pointing out how much power
can be wielded by a noisy and energetic minority.”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The charges of communism are accepted by the state NAACP as
merely one of many “brainwashing” devices used by the whites.
President Hinton answered with the following statement: “The
NAACP is an American and legitimate organization, and not once has
it been even thought of by right thinking people as a subversive organization.
It has never done more than go into the courts, and fight the
issues out before white judges using white men’s laws.”<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>The NAACP, of course, has defended itself against such attacks. It
claims, with much truth, that instead of being a communist-front
organization it is in reality responsible for the fact that the communists
have been unable to make any headway among American
Negroes. The <cite>Record</cite>, however, has taken issue. The real reason
why communists were so unsuccessful in winning over American
Negroes, said a <cite>Record</cite> editorial, was the fact that most of them
lived in the South “and were, like their friends among the Southern
whites, conservatives.” They were not members of the Negro “intelligentsia”
where, according to the capital city paper, communism
had made its only headway among Negroes, and were by every sign
“generally content [and] a happy race” and therefore “anything but
a fertile ground for communist wiles.”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>A new device against the NAACP became popular in 1957, one
which can be used against both the NAACP and labor unions. This
is the so-called “permit system” under which counties and municipalities
might require “any organization, union or society of any sort”
that charged membership fees to obtain permits to sign up new members.
Applications can be denied in the interest of “peace and good
order.” Florence and Abbeville counties have led in requiring the
permits. Several other localities have followed suit.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The attacks on the NAACP contain many other phases. Among
these are the following:</p>

<p>(1) The NAACP is pictured as the Negro counterpart of the white
Ku Klux Klan. Such an association would discredit the NAACP,
for the attempts to revive the Klan are decried by all except the most
radical fringe of white supremacists. White conservatives are determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
not to allow the opposition to the Negro to be taken up by
radicals who would not only endanger their own dominant position
but also completely discredit the white South in the eyes of the nation.
A good example of associating the Klan and the NAACP was a statement
issued by Federal District Judge Ashton H. Williams when the
Edisto Beach case was pending before his court. The two organizations,
he said, were “the real enemies to any progress” in the segregation
controversy. No progress could be made by South Carolina
until both were “wholly eliminated” from the picture. In a severe
condemnation of the NAACP, interesting because he might be called
upon in the future to hear civil rights cases sponsored by the NAACP,
the Judge said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It must be kept in mind that the rights given to Negroes by the Supreme Court
are personal, and no one has a right to persuade them by unlawful threats or
otherwise to exercise the rights given them by the Supreme Court. If the Negroes
wish to accept segregated schools, or segregated beaches, parks and so forth,
it is legally wrong for anyone, by misrepresentation, undue influence, or threats,
to force them to seek personal rights given under the Supreme Court decision.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>(2) Personal and abusive attacks are made on NAACP leaders. In
addition to questioning the sincerity and honesty of purpose of persons
prominent in the association, a vicious racism has crept into many
of the most extreme attacks. G. L. Ivey referred to Thurgood Marshall
as the “mulatto chief counsel for the NAACP.” The writer of
a letter to the editor of the <cite>Morning News</cite> advised the South to “get
rid of the NAACP and the ‘halfbreeds.’” “History tells us,” he
wrote, “that ‘halfbreeds’ have always been trouble makers. The
Bible says that a bastard cannot enter the kingdom of heaven, even
unto the tenth generation.”<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>(3) Blame for originating the state’s race problem is placed solely
on the NAACP. W. D. Workman, Jr., stated that responsibility for
beginning a “cold war” between the races in the state rested “with
the titular Negro leadership, national and state,” by which he meant
the NAACP. The <cite>Record</cite> said the NAACP’s “appeal to the force of
the courts to compel the elimination of segregation” created a climate
in which “racial cooperation” could not exist.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>(4) The NAACP is presented as an enemy of the Negro, existing
only on its ability to coerce. The purpose here is to alienate the
Negro from the NAACP. Eldridge Thompson, a <cite>News and Courier</cite>
writer, insisted that the Association’s progress was based on “the
weapon of fear.” The Negro who did not subscribe to the NAACP
was “afraid to be identified,” he claimed. The grip of the Association
over the Negro community was so great that opposition could not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
organized successfully against it. The reporter concluded that the
rank and file Negro had more to fear from the NAACP than the white
man. S. Emory Rogers told a Lake City Citizens Council that “our
fight is not with the Negroes, they’re our hope, but we’ve got to get
them under the correct leadership.... The NAACP is our chief enemy.”
State Representative Charles G. Garrett of Greenville County, in
supporting the bill to bar NAACP members from state employment,
declared that “the NAACP should no longer be allowed to prey upon
the Negro people of South Carolina” who are paid by the taxpayers.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>(5) The NAACP is pictured as an organization alien to Southern
traditions. According to the <cite>Record</cite>, it was “not a local or indigenous
organization.” It was “foreign to every one of the Southern states”
and therefore owed no loyalty to them. Governor Timmerman stated
that the NAACP was “largely sponsored and financed by white people
who are professional Southern haters and alien to the South.” Therefore
it was the “duty of every responsible Negro to repudiate the false
leadership of the NAACP.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The NAACP has been the victim, not only of a propaganda campaign,
but also of a program of action designed to harass and intimidate
its leaders to the point of discouragement and thus stop the
pressure for the end of segregation. The most effective portions of
this effort have been those undertaken by the state government (discussed
in Chapter <abbr title="Seven">VII</abbr>) and the economic boycott popularized by the
Citizens Councils. The remainder of the “ranting and panting and
wringing and twisting of the South Carolina white professional rabble
rousers”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> has a nuisance value only for the whites and merely postpones
the inevitable question facing the state: education or segregation?</p>

<p>In view of the many pronouncements by Southern whites to the
effect that the NAACP is a “radical” organization, a brief examination
of the association along these lines is necessary. In the last analysis,
the labeling of any organization as “radical” depends upon the light
in which it is considered. If the premise is accepted that segregation
of the races in the public schools is a positive good and that the
abolition of this policy would result in disaster, then the NAACP is
“radical.”</p>

<p>However, there are many indications that the organization was and
is not radical when viewed with detachment. Neither the leadership
nor the membership of the association, noted Myrdal, were “recruited
from the ranks of radicals.” Both its program and tactics were “well
within the bounds of respectability” and its policy was based on the
“acceptance of the fundamentals of the ‘American way’ of life.” An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
examination of the specific objectives of the NAACP upon which this
observation was made reveals such “radical” aims as anti-lynching
legislation, enfranchisement of the Southern Negro, abolition of all
legal injustices based on race or color, equitable distribution of funds
for public education, abolition of inequalities in employment opportunities
based on race or color and the general abolition of “segregation,
discrimination, insult and humiliation” in other areas based
on color or race. In only one important respect, the abolition of public
school segregation, had the NAACP altered its objectives between
1940, when the above goals were outlined, and 1954, when the Supreme
Court ordered an end to school segregation. One of the main sources
of strength of the NAACP in pursuit of its goals has been a willingness
to work within the framework of constitutional legality. Still another
has been a policy of compromise or opportunism—adapting its tactics
to meet local situations. National NAACP headquarters directed
local offices to “secure at least equal rights and accommodations for
colored citizens” in cases where race discriminations were “too strongly
entrenched to be attacked” directly.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> In the post-World War <abbr title="Two">II</abbr> period
there has been a hardening of this attitude and greater emphasis has
been placed on securing integrated facilities.</p>

<p>The policy of the NAACP has been essentially one of moderation
in areas where progress is being made toward its goals. The more
extreme demands have been necessitated by absolute refusal of white
leaders to allow any “advancement” in such areas as school integration.
In opposing various proposals for “gradualism,” which appear
to be little more than an indefinite maintenance of the <i lang="la">status quo</i>, Roy
Wilkins has driven to the heart of the matter. He pointed out that
the Negro was the only American who was being advised “to take
his citizenship on the installment plan.” Two weeks later, however,
he stated that “a plea for understanding [by white Southerners]
based on consideration of timing is understandable. A plea for understanding
based on defiance of constitutional government is a plea
for anarchy and secession.” A. J. Clement, Jr., a prominent Charleston
NAACP leader, was in substantial agreement. “No one concerned
with this problem,” said Clement, “likes to be identified as being
a ‘gradualist’ but, we who are ‘realists,’ have got to understand that
long established customs and habits, no matter how erroneous or abhorrent,
will not suddenly be cast aside. Some individuals are able
to adjust themselves to change much quicker than others. My chief
concern is that there be no ‘backward steps,’ no ‘marking time.’”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>That the NAACP’s policy is essentially moderate has been demonstrated
by its willingness to compromise its position in the face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
threats to close public schools. The <cite>Record</cite> reported that Marshall
and other attorneys for the appellants in the Clarendon case agreed
orally to forego a showdown in the face of a “blunt” warning by school
authorities that segregation was more important to them than education
and that schools would be closed if one Negro applied for admission
to a white school. Marshall, of course, denied this report
but it is significant that, although given virtually a free hand in the
case, he chose not to force the issue.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> State authorities, however,
have no guarantee as to how long Negro leaders will be willing to
compromise their legal position in face of the irreconcilable attitude
taken by whites.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire controversy on the school issue neither Governor
Timmerman nor any other responsible political official in South
Carolina has ever offered to sit down at a conference table with
Negro leaders and to discuss the question. They have blandly
taken the position that there is nothing to discuss. The lines of
communication between the white and Negro populations of the state
have completely broken down. But in point of truth, as North Carolina
pundit Harry Golden has sagely observed, what these same politicians
fear is that the Negro leadership might be so reasonable in its
requests that such could hardly be refused without making the official
policy of South Carolina seem even more ridiculous than it already
is. Governor Timmerman and his advisers know only too well that
the Negro leadership would accede to the most gradual of gradualist
programs provided it was proposed in good faith. But to yield an
inch on “principle,” a word historically dear to South Carolinians, has
literally become an impossibility even for the best intentioned of the
state’s political leaders. They are the prisoners of the morally bankrupt
policy of “massive resistance.”</p>

<h3>THE NEW NULLIFICATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent10 unindent">In cases of deliberate, dangerous and palpable infractions
of the Constitution, affecting the sovereignty of a
state and the liberties of the people, it is not only the
right but the duty of such state to interpose its authority
for their protection.—<cite>Hartford Convention (1814)</cite></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>In the final analysis, the sound and fury of professional hate groups,
white supremacy organizations, “legal” resistance movements, and “voluntary”
segregation advocates would signify nothing without active
leadership and cooperation from the state government. Consequently,
organizations and individuals supporting segregation have made doubly
sure that there is no wavering on the part of public officials. Toward
this end, for example, the Lamar Citizens Council resolved that “the
powers of legislative decision and administrative responsibility must
remain in the exclusive control” of men who supported “constitutional
government, states rights ... individual liberty,” and “the separation
of races in the schools and colleges and social institutions of this state.”<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
Segregationists have had no difficulty whatsoever in achieving this
objective if for no other than the simple reason that political leaders
are of one and the same opinion. Amongst the politicians there has
not been a single instance of deviation from accepted attitudes of
complete racial segregation. With such unanimity of opinion, extremists
inevitably would be able to set the pace in the state legislature.
That is precisely what has happened.</p>

<p>Immediately following the Court decision, much advice, largely
unsolicited, was given to state policy makers. The <cite>News and Courier</cite>
called “for moderation, for calm and wise decisions” in meeting the
crisis. It offered no specific policies for immediate consideration by
state officials but it did suggest for the time being a delaying action,
“a masterly retreat, in the Robert Edward Lee tradition of rear-guard
actions, including flank attacks.” Lest there be any doubt, the Charleston
paper reaffirmed its opposition to “de-segregation, or integration,
or amalgamation or any other tricky method of mixing the races in
public schools.”<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The Florence <cite>Morning News</cite>, too, called for “calm,
reasonable and foresighted” leadership by “statesmen” not “politicians.”
Statesmen, it declared, “are not people who can shout ‘nigger’
and they are not people who can prove—with words—that the Negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
is an inferior animal.” Solution of the problem would result not from
speeches that “inflame groups and excite the passions of extremists,”
but rather from “good sense, calm action and kind reason.”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>W. D. Workman, Jr., the <cite>News and Courier</cite> correspondent in Columbia,
thought South Carolina could take any one of five actions: acceptance
of the Court decision; “nullification” of the decision; abolition
of public schools; “evasive action,” such as the establishment of a
private school system to circumvent the Court decision; or “passive
resistance” which he deftly defined as “non-compliance rather than
open defiance.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>The legislature was not in session at the time of the original ruling.
Therefore immediate policy decisions had to be made by Governor
James F. Byrnes. The latter decided that since the Supreme Court
had failed to implement its decree, it was unnecessary to call a special
session of the legislature. On May 20, 1954, however, he ordered a
halt to all school construction under the state’s equalization program.
In July the Gressette Committee recommended resumption of construction
and the ban was lifted on August 31.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The new school building program represents the state’s one real constructive
reaction to Negro integration efforts. The purpose may
have been less an altruistic desire to improve Negro education than
to furnish the state with another arguing point in the preservation of
segregation. Whatever the motive, an immediate result has been to
provide Negroes with greatly improved, though still segregated, educational
facilities.</p>

<p>Early in 1956 Dr. E. Ryan Crow, the able director of the “equalization”
program, announced that despite “a fatal indifference to equalizing
facilities for Negroes” in some areas, the program had been approximately
85 percent completed. The program’s magnitude demonstrates
that South Carolina whites, when pushed far enough, will
make efforts to equalize the Negro schools—at least from a physical
standpoint. Expenditures in Clarendon County are indicative: between
1951 and 1956 the state spent $770,576 on white school construction
as against $2,166,895 on Negro school construction. In the Summerton
school district which was directly involved in the case, $102,596
was spent on white school construction as compared to $892,114 for
Negro school construction.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>In the gubernatorial election of 1954, George Bell Timmerman, Jr.,
who had been lieutenant governor for eight years, was chosen to succeed
Governor Byrnes. Taking office in January, 1955, Governor
Timmerman, son of the Federal District Judge who had ruled against
the Negro plaintiffs in the Clarendon County case, became the key<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
figure in the state’s official opposition to any and all desegregation.
For this reason his public statements are of special significance. The
new Governor, a forty-five year old lawyer from Lexington County,
is a humorless and fanatical segregationist. On one occasion he told
a national television audience that segregation in the state would not
end “in a thousand years.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Considering the problem in its more
immediate implications, he said on another occasion: “If you let one
[Negro] child come in ... you’ve opened the door. There can’t be
any compromise—you can’t compromise right with wrong.” In still
another instance he declared: “With the knowledge that right, justice
and truth are our allies, we shall not fail. There shall be no compulsory
racial mixing in our state.”<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Timmerman insisted that segregation did not involve discrimination.
Equality went “hand in hand” with separation. In developing this
theme the Governor added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The two terms [discrimination and segregation] are not interchangeable. I
am opposed to discrimination on any grounds, racial or otherwise, but it does
not necessarily follow that racial discrimination results from racial separation.
If anything separation makes for less discrimination, for it does not provide a
basis for the inevitable discrimination which will follow if white and Negro
children are mingled in the same schools and the same classrooms.</p>

<p>... The “separate-but-equal” policy provides a fair and practicable basis for
race relations in South Carolina. If the administration of the law in years past
has been faulty, the need is for improved administration such as we are now
giving, not abandonment of the principle itself.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Timmerman asserted that the positive “benefits” of segregation
were realized by the state’s Negro population. He claimed that
“many Negro parents living in Washington and other cities to the
North of us are leaving their children with relatives in our State so
that their children can enjoy the benefit of a Southern climate in
segregated public schools.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> The Governor did not say whether he
was referring to climate in its physical aspects or in the realm of opinion
and mores.</p>

<p>In his inaugural address, Timmerman criticized even the suggestion
of a moderate consideration of the segregation issue. “The cowardly
approach of gradualism,” he described as “the essence of discrimination,”
“a creeping evil” that had no place in “the government of a
free people.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Constantly reiterating that “white parents” and “most
Negro parents” opposed integration, he applauded “the calm attitude”
in which white South Carolinians had approached the issue. Since
the latter were determined to resist integration, “the sensible choice
of the Negro” was to accept and support separate but equal schools.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
“Our common task is one of patience, understanding and unyielding
determination,” said the Governor. “In this way we can minimize
some of the tragedy which the Supreme Court would impose upon us
all. There will be no compulsory racial mixing in our state.”<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Also indicative was Timmerman’s criticism of President Eisenhower’s
appeal that every American be “judged and measured by what he is,
rather than by his color, race or religion.” He complained that “never
before has a national administration proclaimed as unimportant a
person’s race and religion.” How better, he asked, could a person be
“judged and measured” as to what he is? “A man’s most priceless
possession is his heritage. A man’s most priceless achievement is his
religious faith.”<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Whatever one may think of it, Timmerman’s attitude is in no sense
hypocritical; it is in complete consonance with his political credo. He
is a conservative in the peculiarly Southern sense of the word, a racist,
a states righter, an advocate of decentralized government. In referring
to federal aid to education, he declared: “As far as I am concerned,
if I must be taxed and controlled, I would rather be taxed by
laws enacted sensibly by local representatives of my own state in
whose election I have some choice, than to be taxed ill-advisedly by
representatives of the other states, in whose selection I have no
choice.”<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The full measure of his political conservatism is reflected
in a speech delivered before the Southern regional conference of the
Association of State Governments at Charleston in the spring of 1956.
George Washington, he said, gave “to posterity prophetic advice of
strikingly current significance” when he cautioned against a “spirit of
innovation” upon the principles embodied in the Constitution. Such
a “spirit,” warned the Governor, was “prevalent and growing.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>The state legislature and the special school segregation committee,
headed by Senator L. Marion Gressette of Calhoun County, also have
played leading roles in the official opposition to integration. The
Gressette Committee, consisting of 15 members appointed by the Governor,
Lieutenant Governor E. F. Hollings and Speaker of the State
House of Representatives Solomon Blatt, one of that rare variety of
Jewish segregationists, had been formed in 1951 as a result of the
Clarendon County school case. Shortly after the 1954 ruling, the
committee embarked in earnest on its task of determining the best
course to be followed in circumventing the integration drive. Beginning
in July the committee held a series of closed hearings which
sounded out the attitudes of leading individuals and groups. It heard
from such diverse individuals as the presidents of all state supported
colleges, including Dr. Benner C. Turner of the state Negro college;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
former Governor Byrnes; E. H. Agnew, president of the state Farm
Bureau Federation; G. L. Ivey, president of the Florence National
Association for the Advancement of White People; representatives
from the Charleston NAACP and the Negro teachers association.</p>

<p>The initial efforts of the committee were generally applauded. The
<cite>News and Courier</cite> praised its “statesmanlike and cautious approach.”<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
The <cite>Morning News</cite> was somewhat more reserved. In addition to
criticizing the closed hearings, Editor O’Dowd suggested that the scope
of the committee’s responsibility be widened to include a study of the
price South Carolina was willing to pay for segregated schools. The
same paper made the ingenious proposal that a “devil’s advocate,” an
“open and declared advocate of integration,” be placed on the committee.
Such a person, it was pointed out, could expose the flaws in
the various plans for continuing segregation.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>In justifying the closed hearings, the committee’s first interim report
explained that this was done “to avoid hasty action and public misunderstanding,
which could cause inflammation and friction.”<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> In
at least one instance what transpired behind committee doors was revealed
to the press. In a letter to the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, A. J. Clement,
Jr., the Charleston NAACP president, stated that when appearing
before the committee, he had urged “that South Carolina accept the
Supreme Court decision” and begin steps toward desegregation “forthwith.”
Clement acknowledged the magnitude of the problem involved.
“Molds and patterns of living, customs and habits in daily activities”
could not be altered overnight. The state of New Jersey provided
an example of gradual desegregation such as Clement envisaged for
South Carolina. In New Jersey the Negro had “all of the educational,
civic, political opportunities” he was fighting for in South Carolina.
Yet “the mark, the impression, the influence, the stunting effects of
former discriminatory practices and racial segregations” were still
present. He appealed to the Gressette Committee to take the initial
step toward desegregation in South Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>The attitude of the Gressette Committee has been revealed in its
reports to the state legislature and in speeches by its chairman. The
latter, like the Governor, holds that a majority of Negroes desire
segregation. On one occasion he asserted that 98 percent of the state’s
Negroes were uninterested in forcibly integrating the races. (Significantly,
he neglected to say whether these same Negroes would be
opposed to integration if the question of force was not involved.) To
buttress his opinion, Gressette cited the NAACP’s “failure to obtain
more petitions” for integration in the public schools, despite its alleged
use of “fraud, deceit and misrepresentation.” Similar ideas have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
expressed in committee reports. In January, 1955, the committee
found no reason to alter its view “that the consensus of public opinion
in the State favors better educational opportunity for children—in
separate schools.” Such a view is in all probability substantially
true but the matter is academic since the Supreme Court has ruled
otherwise. The following December, the committee revealed there
were “many indications, and few if any to the contrary, that sentiment
in favor of separate schools and against integrated schools” had crystallized
during 1956. It further expressed agreement “with those who
maintain that the decision of the United States Supreme Court was
improper,” representing a usurpation of executive and legislative
functions by the Supreme Court. And it proposed “to employ every
legal means” to maintain a segregated school system which it “in good
conscience” believed to be “in the best interests” of the children of
both races. With some real basis in fact the Committee held that
events were proving “that the Court did not intend to force integration
on an unwilling people.”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>The public school system is, of course, the key factor in the segregation-integration
controversy. The one great trump card, though a
miserable joker for the children of the state, is the threat to close
down the public school system if integration is ordered. It has been
spelled out to leave no doubts. If a Negro pupil is admitted to a
white school by court order, both the white and Negro schools which
are involved are to be closed. This threat takes in not only
primary and secondary public schools but also state supported institutions
of higher education, including graduate and professional
schools.</p>

<p>Reactions have varied to the possibility of closing the public schools.
Lieutenant Governor E. F. Hollings, opposing such action, asserted
that “it’s foolish to even consider for a moment that abolishing public
education is the solution.” On another occasion he insisted: “We can
never abandon our public school system.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Yet he reassured the
people that schools were “intended for education and not integration.”<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
And since segregation was a “natural thing,” it followed
that “a majority of Negroes” was no more enthusiastic about integration
than whites. The Lieutenant Governor took the realistic position
that any private school plan “might be tossed out by the court as a
‘trick’ designed to circumvent the decree.”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> He advocated a system
that would be premised on local control. Pupils would be assigned
to schools by the local superintendent or trustees on a basis other
than race—“sex, aptitude, proximity of school to home and available<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
classroom space.” Such a plan, he thought, would meet the requirements
of the court.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>W. D. Workman, Jr., in evaluating public opinion on the abolition
of the public schools, considered it “extremely doubtful” that a majority
of South Carolinians was prepared to do away with the system
altogether. None the less he reported that “in some parts of the state,”
white parents considered segregation more important than education.
The <cite>News and Courier</cite> editorially agreed. “Compulsory mingling of
the races in public schools,” it announced, would be “a worse thing
than closing them.” The Charleston paper attacked the public school
system <i lang="la">per se</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Many thoughtful citizens of South Carolina long have been dissatisfied with
the educational performance of our public schools. We say this not in criticism
of public school teachers or officials, because it has been the system—rather
than the participants in the system—which is at fault.</p>

<p>The public schools have suffered because of political pressures, complacency
due to lack of competition and a trend to gear lessons to the dullest of the
pupils. Social promotions, progressive education and over-emphasis on athletics
and such nonsense as drum majorettes and beauty contests have lowered the
educational standards of public schools....</p>

<p>In the future, South Carolinians who do not wish to send their children to
public schools should be encouraged to send them to private schools. This
encouragement should be in the form of an allotment of money by the state
toward the private school tuition of any child who does not attend public
schools....</p>

<p>We believe that private schools which offered a poor education soon would
go out of business, and that private schools which offered a good education
would thrive and multiply. There would be competition among private schools
to do a good educational job. At present there is no competition among public
schools....<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Others expressed like sentiments. Henry E. Davis, a Florence
attorney, told the local Citizens Council: “Close your schools if it
comes to that.... Closing public schools is not such a calamity and
private schools get the best results anyway.” Another Citizens Council
speaker, state representative O. L. Warr of Lamar, advised a
Beaufort rally that rather than accept integration, public schools
should be abandoned “reluctantly but inflexibly without flinch or falter.”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
The letter of T. H. McFaddin of Gable to the <cite>News and Courier</cite>
is revealing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Any court that does not consider what is best for the white child, in my opinion
is a kangaroo court. No one can read into the Constitution, that any child
should be found guilty for being born a white child and be sentenced to over
three quarters of every year during its school term to be mixed with children of
another race. For there is no commandment that reads, Thou shalt not keep
thy race pure....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Books are cheap. Education can be gotten by mail to a great extent ... the
only way to beat this school mixture of the races is to advertise all school
property for sale.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>A few outspoken champions of the public school system have come
forward to be heard. <cite>Morning News</cite> Editor O’Dowd declared that
“our educational system is of more importance than mores, political
opposition, state-wide resentment or mass disappointment.”<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Likewise
Mrs. C. B. Busbee, head of the education department of the South
Carolina Federation of Women’s Clubs, said that “the abandonment
of a system of public schools would set back the cause of education
for all our people 100 years.”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>In view of the role of the schoolhouse in the segregation controversy,
the attitude of education groups is significant. The Council of Delegates
of the South Carolina Education Association, an organization
of white classroom teachers and administrators, in October, 1954,
approved a resolution which held segregated schools “the best form of
organization for meeting the needs of children of both races,” and urged
“an adequate system of free public schools in South Carolina be
maintained.”<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Other education groups have been more hesitant to
state their positions. Not until August, 1955, more than a year after
the court decision, did the Association of School Administrators and
the School Boards Association, an organization of school trustees,
take their stand. The School Administrators pledged themselves “to
the preservation, continuation, and improvement of the public school
system of South Carolina.” The school trustees adopted a resolution
which observed that “as long as the State of South Carolina, through
its legislative authority, continues its policy of withholding funds for
the operation of integrated schools, our schools must continue to be
segregated if they are to remain open.” The trustees pledged themselves
to keep the public schools open “so that responsibility for closing
them must be assumed by other authorities.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> A sad commentary
is that no one administratively connected with any state supported
institution of higher learning publicly has opposed the state’s threat
to close those institutions if a Negro were admitted. To summarize,
the threatened abolition of the public school system would indicate
lack of appreciation by white South Carolinians of the fundamental
role of a system of free education in a democratic society.</p>

<p>The question of federal aid to education naturally has intruded
itself into the school integration controversy. So intense is the feeling
on this subject that it has become another of the articles of faith upon
which orthodoxy is demanded of all public spokesmen. Without doubt
a large majority of white South Carolinians agreed with the <cite>News and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Courier</cite> when it referred to federal aid to education as “bribery” to
be used by integrationists. Governor Timmerman characterized federal
aid as “sugar-coated federal taxation.” He told the 1956 General
Assembly that propaganda for federal aid to education fostered upon
the people “a big political hoax, the claim of an acute shortage of
school buildings.” That contention, said the Governor, was “simply
untrue.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Some South Carolina school administrators might have
been disposed to disagree were it discreet to do so.</p>

<p>Public officials and other leaders in the state have spoken out against
federal aid, especially if it suggests any inkling of federal control.
That South Carolina’s schools are already receiving hundreds of thousands
of dollars of federal money for educational purposes has been
conveniently overlooked. Most spokesmen oppose federal aid <i lang="la">per se</i>.
Occasionally, however, proposals have been made which are designed
to give the states federal money with no strings attached. For example,
University of South Carolina President Donald Russell who
resigned in October, 1957, to run for governor, suggested that the federal
government return to the states on a per capita basis ten percent
of all federal income taxes collected. This plan, declared Russell,
would involve no federal control and thus would test the sincerity
of “those who would pervert the matter of federal aid into a coercive
weapon to promote some alien or sociological goal.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>The state legislature expressed itself on the subject in March, 1957.
The House of Representatives adopted a resolution, introduced by
<abbr title="Representative">Rep.</abbr> P. Eugene Brabham of Bamberg, which noted that South Carolinians
“are now, always have been and shall always be unequivocally,
incontrovertibly and unalterably opposed to any federal invasion, encroachment
or infringement of the fundamental right, obligation and
duty of the people and their local authority to provide, supervise
and control the education of the children of this state or the educational
processes concomitant thereon.”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>A central theme of the opponents of federal aid to education is the
contention that South Carolina does not need any more money for
operation of its schools. They point with pride to the large scale
school building program which the state has undertaken in response
to the demands by Negroes for racial integration. The South Carolina
Conference of Education, a group appointed by Governor Byrnes to
study education in the state, reported in late 1955 that in regard to
federal aid to education “no funds are sought or desired, except in
those areas like North Charleston or Aiken where federal installations
have caused increases in school population out of all proportion
to normal growth and development.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Opponents of federal aid usually overlook all factors in the school
program except classroom construction. They disregard the pitifully
low salaries of classroom teachers and the resultant insufficient training
of many teachers. They also tend to ignore the results of tests
conducted by the American Council of Education. South Carolina
students, according to results announced early in 1956, ranked nationally
as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>34th in English correctness and effectiveness of expression</li>
<li>36th in general mathematical ability</li>
<li>42nd in interpretation of literary material</li>
<li>46th in interpretation of reading material on the natural sciences</li>
<li>47th in interpretation of reading material in social studies</li>
</ul>

<p>According to a 1958 report of the National Education Association,
South Carolina ranks at the very bottom of the nation in its record of
public school education. Among the states it is 48th in the number
of median school years completed by persons 25 years of age and older.
It is 47th in the per cent of adult (25 years and older) population with
less than five years of schooling (27.4 per cent of its adults have less
than five years of formal education) and it is 48th in the percentage of
its adult population who have completed four years of high school. It
occupies 47th position in the percentage of selective service registrants
disqualified by mental tests. In the percentage of its eighth grade enrollment
going on to finish high school the Palmetto State is 46th.
With regard to teacher pay, South Carolina ranks 45th; the average
salary of its classroom teachers is $3,250.</p>

<p>Statistics such as these hardly give credence to <abbr title="Representative">Rep.</abbr> Ashmore’s
statement that “what South Carolina has done with its schools
is evidence in itself any state in the union can take care of its own
school needs.”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The press of the state generally denounces federal aid for education.
The <cite>News and Courier</cite> went so far as to condemn federally subsidized
school lunches. If school children should get such lunches, it argued,
they should also receive suppers and breakfasts. “The difference
between government-sponsored school lunches and the welfare state
is only a matter of degree.” Similarly, the <cite>Record</cite> thought that federal
aid could destroy “freedom and inventiveness in the schools” while
the <cite>Morning News</cite> suggested it would in reality make less funds available
for education because of the bureaucratic costs of collecting the
taxes and sending the money back to the states.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>On occasion, however, a newspaper editorialist has questioned the
arguments used against federal aid. The <cite>Independent</cite>, rarely missing
a chance to lash out against former Governor Byrnes, wondered how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
the Palmetto State’s elder statesman could oppose federal taxation
of South Carolinians for building schools in other states and not oppose
taxation of citizens of other states to build defense and military installations
in South Carolina. Driving this point home, the Anderson
newspaper then stated that in the past both South Carolina and
Byrnes had received far more money through federal channels than
they had paid out in federal taxes. Likewise the <cite>Morning News</cite> objected
to arguments that federal aid was socialism. Socialism, said
the Florence newspaper, depended on whether South Carolina got
anything from it. “Our politicians say they will not accept federal
aid to education because it is socialistic.... The truth is that they
do not need this particular aid, so they can refuse it with indignation.”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>A concrete instance of the federal aid to education question came
to light in mid-August of 1957 when Clemson College, the state’s
agricultural and engineering school for whites, rejected a grant of
$350,000 from the Atomic Energy Commission. According to the
provisions of the grant, of which the college’s board of trustees had
accepted an initial payment of $99,050, “the grantee agrees that no
person shall be barred from participation in the educational and training
program involved or be the subject of other unfavorable discrimination
on the basis of race, color, creed, or religion.” Inasmuch as
racial discrimination undeniably existed at Clemson, the trustees belatedly
decided to withdraw from the agreement with the AEC and
to return to it the $99,050. Clemson president R. E. Poole stressed,
however, that the college’s nuclear testing and experimental program
would continue.</p>

<p>Governor Timmerman, choosing to ignore the obvious racial discrimination
at Clemson, defended the college’s action on the far less
realistic grounds that the inclusion of the word “creed” in the conditions
of the grant would prohibit Clemson authorities from denying
participation in the atomic energy program to a Communist. This
lawyer’s trick in semantics was applauded by the Columbia <cite>State</cite>
which ironically at this very time was leading a last-ditch fight to
prevent the closing of nearby Fort Jackson, a federal military installation
on which not a small part of Columbia’s economic well being
directly depends. “This affair,” pontificated the <cite>State</cite>, “is an affirmation
of the principle that federal aid means federal control.” The
<cite>News and Courier</cite> also praised Clemson’s action, though recognizing
that its atomic energy program would have to be reduced in scope
to the detriment of the state. “So far as we know,” said the Charleston
paper, “Clemson is the first Southern college to make such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
forthright choice between freedom and government handouts. Other
colleges sooner or later will have to make the same decision. We hope
they will be guided by the example of the Clemson trustees. We do
not know how many federal dollars the choice of freedom will cost
Southern colleges. Freedom is an expensive commodity. It is worth
every cent.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>Though the state legislature did not reach the zenith of its anti-integration
zeal until 1956, its 1955 session provided an informative
prelude. Legislators in 1955 were more hesitant than a year later,
perhaps because the Supreme Court had not yet implemented the
original decision. Nevertheless a number of important measures were
adopted. The Gressette committee recommended and the legislature
adopted proposals that repealed the state’s compulsory attendance law,
gave local school trustees authority to sell or lease school property,
and prohibited automatic renewal of teacher contracts.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Only the repeal of the state’s compulsory school attendance law
evoked any considerable opposition. In the Senate Lewis Wallace
of York County alone opposed repeal and then on the curious grounds
that the measure was an “abject surrender” to the Court decision.
Greater objection developed in the House. The House Education
Committee approved the measure thirteen to eight but on the floor
Representative Richard L. Breeland of Richland County, a high
school teacher and lawyer, led the opposition. He urged that repeal
be postponed until after the Supreme Court had given its final ruling.
“In clearing the decks,” he said, “let’s be careful we don’t sink the
ship.” His chief adversary in debate was John Calhoun Hart, an
impulsive school teacher from Union County. “Our very way of
life is at stake,” he exclaimed. “Our ethnological makeup may be
swept away. If we falter, we shall go down into the sewer of mongrelism.”<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
The repeal of this law was generally accepted as an unpleasant
but imperative move.</p>

<p>The <cite>Independent</cite> regarded the repeal measure, along with other
laws which undermined the public school system, as a tactical action
necessary “to realize the overall strategy of maintaining segregated
schools.”<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> In abrogating the law the legislature was simply reflecting
the will of the people, thought the <cite>News and Courier</cite>. In thus functioning
“as a truly representative body in a Republic,” the legislature
was observing a principle “more important than the compulsory attendance
law, or even public education itself.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> By analogy, then,
if the people of South Carolina were bent upon intellectual suicide,
the logic of the Charleston paper would have the legislature legally
send them to their destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
In several other particulars, the 1955 legislature sought to hold
the segregation line. Most important was a provision in the general
state appropriation bill which stated that: “Appropriations of state
aid for teachers, salaries, and all other school district, county and state
appropriations for the operation of the public school system shall
cease and become inoperative for any school from which, and for any
school to which, any pupil may transfer pursuant to, or in consequence
of, any order of any court, for the time that the pupil shall attend a
school other than the school to which he was assigned before the
issuance of such court order.”<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>The legislators also called upon Congress “to enact legislation limiting
the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court
and the jurisdiction of the other Federal Courts so that the fields of
government of the executive and legislative branches and that of the
several states shall not be invaded, but shall remain separate and distinct.”
Later the legislators, in urging the Supreme Court not to
implement its earlier decision, declared that integration in South
Carolina would result in “hatred, strife, chaos and confusion,” and the
“possible wrecking of the educational program.” Consequently, “at
no time in the foreseeable future” would it be possible to desegregate
the public schools of South Carolina. Reflecting a blindness to the
realities of the twentieth century, the resolution concluded on a note
of perverse logic that the continuation of segregation would weld and
unite America and thus enable the country to present “a solid front
of democracy” to the world.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>In 1956 the state legislature enacted anti-integration and anti-NAACP
proposals at almost a mass production rate. If no pertinent
law could be enacted, the legislators adopted, usually unanimously,
resolutions to express their opinion on a particular phase of the integration
controversy. Altogether more than a dozen important measures
were passed. These included a resolution of interposition; a
law requiring white colleges and the Negro college to close if integration
were ordered by the courts; a law barring NAACP members from
state, county or local government employment; a resolution ordering
an investigation of NAACP activities at the state Negro college; a
resolution requesting the federal government to place the NAACP on
the attorney general’s subversive list; a provision limiting all appropriations
for state schools and parks to segregated schools and parks
only; a law closing Edisto Beach State Park because Negroes had
filed a court suit seeking admission; a resolution requesting the State
Library Board to remove current, and screen future, books “inimical
and antagonistic” to the segregation customs of the state; a resolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
commending the Citizens Councils; a resolution requesting President
Eisenhower to restore segregation in the nation’s armed forces to rebuild
morale and <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>; the establishment of the Gressette
Committee as a permanent legislative committee; a measure giving
local law enforcement officers the power to transfer pupils from one
school to another to avoid “civil commotion;” an enactment giving
local school boards the power to make enrollment rules and regulations
having the force and effect of law, appeals from such rules to be
channeled through state courts; and finally a resolution stating the
legislators’ support of continued bus segregation.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Of all these actions the interposition resolution received the most
publicity. Revived during the period by Editor James J. Kilpatrick
of the Richmond, Virginia, <cite>News Leader</cite>, interposition has become
the shopworn answer of the states righters and “constitutionalists” to
the integration controversy. It is designed to please those elements
which have rationalized their prejudices and objections to racial integration
on constitutional grounds. Their contention, rightly held to
be sure, is that the founding fathers had not contemplated integration
in 1787 when they wrote the Constitution. Also appealing is the long
and hoary history of interposition and its companion nullification. It
had begun in 1798 and 1799 with the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions
of Jefferson and Madison and subsequently had run through the
Hartford Convention of 1814, Calhoun’s nullification attempts in 1832
and Wisconsin’s refusal to accept the Fugitive Slave Law in 1859.
The Virginia resolution and the Hartford Convention both used the
term “interpose.” Illustrating that the use of interposition or nullification
was more a weapon of the political outs than of a geographic
section, the Hartford Convention, in terms worthy of the best states
righters of the 1950’s, had declared that “in cases of deliberate, dangerous
and palpable infractions of the Constitution, affecting the sovereignty
of a state and the liberties of the people, it is not only the
right but the duty of such state to interpose its authority for their
protection.”</p>

<p>The historically outmoded theory behind interposition is the core
of the states rights argument: the federal government is a creature
of the states, which had united to establish a central authority. The
Constitution set the rules and regulations which governed that central
authority. Ultimate sovereignty, however, continued to rest with the
states. If the people of the states felt that the federal government
had exceeded its authority, then they—acting through the states—had
the power to challenge the action of the federal government.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> In
theory the challenge would take the form of a suspensive veto which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
would hold the particular act of the federal government to be null
and void until approved by ¾ of the states by a constitutional amendment.
The theory resolved itself into a basic question: Is the federal
government or are the state governments the final judge of the authority
of the federal government? Historically, the political outs have
answered the states, though the Civil War, certainly if it meant anything
constitutionally speaking, proved the contrary to be true. In
the 1950’s the South represented the political outs in the segregation
controversy.</p>

<p>The interposition doctrine connoted different things to different
people; consequently, it produced varied reactions. Governor Timmerman,
who considered interposition a form of protest, believed it
“fundamentally sound.” Representative James L. Richards, dean of
the state’s congressional delegation and Chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, praised interposition as a means of protest but
balked at talk of nullification. Interposition he defined as “an assertion,
a protest, and a declaration of opinion of illegality.” He urged
South Carolinians to “avoid the passion and hysteria that will lead
men to ‘ride at night,’ take the law into their own hands, or insult
the United States flag.”<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> On the other hand, the silver-maned Congressman
L. Mendel Rivers of Charleston declared that “interposition
is worthless unless it carries with it the corresponding power of nullification.”
Indicating that at least one later day Charlestonian had
learned nothing from the nullification crisis of 1832, Rivers asserted
that “interposition without nullification is a knife without an edge, a
gun without bullets, a plane without an engine or a head without a
body.”<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Similarly, S. Emory Rogers, the Summerton attorney and
Citizens Council leader, agreed that there could be “no effective interposition
without nullification.”<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Newspaper opinion also varied. The <cite>Record</cite> considered interposition
“sound” when viewed “as a device for formalizing the states’
protest against amendment of the Constitution by judicial decision.”
But like Representative Richards, the <cite>Record</cite> looked upon any nullification
proposal as “counsel of confusion” which could be supported
“only by ... outdated law and pre-Confederate War logic.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The
<cite>Morning News</cite> endorsed interposition as “in all probability, the only
proper answer” to the segregation controversy. However, it cautioned
interposition advocates to be prepared to accept the possible consequences.
Should the nation admit the challenge of the interposition
theory and in fact approve the integration decision by constitutional
amendment, the South would be bound by its own doctrine to adopt
integration.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Such an eventuality would test the sincerity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
constitutional objections to integration. The <cite>Independent</cite>, while considering
interposition “worthy of the test,” also realized this danger.
In the main, however, the Anderson paper was wary of the whole
doctrine because of its support by economic conservatives. “Is there
thought in some quarters,” asked the <cite>Independent</cite>, “that the doctrine
might be used to combat not racial decisions alone, but also decisions
and legislation dealing with such matters as wages and hours, old age
pensions, health insurance, right to work laws and other issues that
might arise in the future?”<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> gave unqualified assent to interposition
but never definitely identified the doctrine with outright nullification.
That this paper was willing to carry the issue to an extreme, however,
was demonstrated on several occasions. Southerners, it declared,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>... understand, we believe, the meaning of nullification. Though many are
afraid of the consequences—they have been coerced, bought and brainwashed for
nearly a quarter of a century now—there are many others who are eager for
a showdown.</p>

<p>Southerners do not talk about Civil War <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>. That is a bogeyman to scare the
faint of heart. There will be no war. There may be “economic sanctions” such
as withholding of some form of federal aid....</p>

<p>Whatever may be the form of interposition, the South will not, cannot and
should not accept dictatorship while breath remains in Southern breasts....</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>For many reasons the <cite>News and Courier</cite> advocated interposition,
the most important being that it “could raise the issue above the
tumult and the shouting” of race and thus place “state sovereignty
on the highest plane.” The doctrine “should be held in reserve for
use in cases of maximum gravity.”<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Interposition was first considered seriously late in 1955. In January,
1956, Governor Timmerman and several other Southern governors
attended a conference in Richmond, Virginia, where the problem
was discussed with a view toward united action. The conference
approved a statement urging all the Southern states to adopt a “resolution
of interposition or protest.” Upon returning from the conference,
Governor Timmerman recommended that the state legislature
approve such a resolution. He described the interposition doctrine
as representing “the studious thought and deliberate work of the men
who have provided sound advice and wise leadership in this crisis.”<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>A resolution interposing the sovereignty of the state of South Carolina
between its people and the federal government was introduced
into the legislature by Senator Gressette on January 31 and adopted
February 14. It condemned “the illegal encroachment by the central
government into the reserved powers of the states and the rights of
the people.” The resolution protested “against the grave threat to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
constitutional government, implicit in the recent decisions of the Supreme
Court of the United States.” Eight closely connected reasons
were enumerated in justification for interposition. “The right of
each of the States to maintain ... racially separate public schools ...
is not forbidden or limited” by the Fourteenth Amendment. When
the Supreme Court handed down its desegregation decision, it departed
from “the sanctity of past decisions” and relied “on the current
political and social philosophy of its members.” Such in effect constituted
an amendment to the Constitution, since the Court ignored
the “principle that the meaning of the Constitution and its Amendments
does not change. It is a written instrument.” This usurpation
of power by the Court transcended even the “problems of segregation
in education.” Under such circumstances the sovereign state of South
Carolina could “judge for itself of the infraction of the Constitution.”</p>

<p>For these reasons, then, the legislature resolved that the Court decision
was “a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous attempt to change
the true intent and meaning of the Constitution;” that the state
“condemns and protests” against this illegal encroachment of the federal
government upon the rights of the states; and that South Carolina
reserved for itself the right to take such “legal measures” as it might
deem appropriate “to protect its sovereignty and the rights of its
people.”<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Scattered opposition developed in the legislature against the resolution.
The more extreme elements clamored for a stronger statement!
One of the modern “fire eaters,” Representative George Harrell of
Florence, previously had introduced an interposition resolution in the
House on January 10, 1956, which would have declared “that the
decision of the Supreme Court of the United States holding that segregation
of races in public schools of this state is unconstitutional, <a id="chg1"></a>is, in
itself, unconstitutional, contrary to law, and therefore null and void
and of no effect so far as this state is concerned.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> On the House
floor, Representative John M. Horlbeck of Charleston echoed the <cite>News
and Courier</cite>: “This is a resolution of protest and not of interposition.
There are many who think that this resolution should state a positive
position asserting and pledging the authority of the State to prevent
the implementation of what this resolution terms an unlawful decree.
I am of this opinion.”<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>The press of the state underscored the protest nature of the Timmerman
resolution. The political writer, W. D. Workman, Jr., termed
it “a states rights resolution which is well-worded, well-reasoned and
eminently logical, but ... NOT an interposition resolution.” It
marched “briskly” up to the threshold of interposition and then stopped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Decrying such hesitation, he declared that “somewhere, sometime,
somehow, the people and the states must stand and fight, or else watch
the American form of government evolve into centralism.”<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The
<cite>Independent</cite> agreed. The resolution, thought this upcountry paper,
amounted to nothing more than a protest. Since no assertion was
made of “the state’s claim to the right of outright nullification,” it
was meaningless. The Anderson daily questioned the seriousness of
state political leadership in the whole interposition affair.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The <cite>Record</cite>,
which strongly opposed all implications of nullification, praised
the resolution as a “solemn protest” and a “dignified document.” It
condemned the trend in the nation toward “an all-powerful central
government, constructed in the form of an absolute democracy” in
which the minority would have no rights. This situation was caused
by the political thinking of the big Northern cities—thinking that
was partially to be explained “by the high proportion of European
immigrants in their population.” These people could not “even understand”
such historical American concepts as states rights.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Shades
of John C. Calhoun, perhaps, but completely comprehensible to regular
readers of the <cite>Record’s</cite> xenophobic editorials.</p>

<p>Expressing similar views, Senator Gressette said that the resolution
would serve notice to all America that the major political parties
were “victims of small pressure groups ... in some of the larger cities
and states of the North and East.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>The full implications of the doctrine of interposition emerged in
stark reality early in September when Governor Orval Faubus of
Arkansas called out the state’s national guard to prevent implementation
of a federal court decree ordering the integration of a Little
Rock high school. Though Faubus made no reference to interposition
and claimed that he had called out the troops solely to maintain order
and to prevent bloodshed, many South Carolinians insisted, and with
some reason, that the Governor’s defiance of federal authority constituted
interposition in effect if not in name. “Use of state troops
to prevent Little Rock’s school board from carrying out integration
orders of a federal judge is a direct act of interposition,” said a <cite>News
and Courier</cite> editorial. “The doctrine of interposition,” it added, “has
been hazy in the minds of many persons, even in the South. Now it
has taken shape in the form of state troops on school patrol.” The
following morning the <cite>State</cite> followed the lead of the Charleston paper:
“We have in Arkansas a first-class example of interposition—a state
putting itself between the federal government and the people.” A
few days later the same paper leveled an editorial blast against
United States District Judge Ronald N. Davies who issued the integration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
decree. “In the first place a North Dakota judge, no matter
how learned he may be in law or how sternly he can throw around
his bantamweight, should never have been put in the position of
making the integration ruling in Little Rock,” said Editor Samuel
Latimer. “He couldn’t possibly have any deep understanding of
the relationship between the whites and Negroes in the South and because
of this shallow knowledge he has created a most unpleasant
situation.” Mr. Latimer’s analysis was a bit ironic since the <cite>State’s</cite>
editorials had constantly demanded that judicial decisions be premised
on law and not the sociological opinions of the judges.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>Measures taken against the NAACP are another important phase in
the state’s efforts to preserve segregation unimpaired. These have given
official direction to the drive to eradicate the NAACP in South Carolina.
In February, 1956, the state legislature unanimously adopted a resolution
urging the attorney general of the United States to classify the
NAACP “as a subversive organization so that it may be kept under the
proper surveillance and that all citizens of the United States may have
ample warning of the danger to our way of life which lurks in such an
organization.” By way of justification the legislators maintained that
the files of the Un-American Activities Committee of the national
House of Representatives contained records “of affiliation with ...
subversive organizations or activities” of 53 leading officials of the
NAACP. Among the individuals so listed were A. Philip Randolph,
Mary McLeod Bethune, Oscar Hammerstein <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, Channing H. Tobias,
William H. Hastie, Benjamin E. Mays, Arthur B. Spingarn, Ralph
Bunche, Allen Knight Chalmers, Norman Cousins, and James Hinton.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>In March the legislators approved a law barring all members of the
NAACP from employment by state, county or local governments.
It declared that the NAACP exerted “constant pressure on its members
contrary to the principles upon which the economic and social
life of our state rests.” Membership in the organization was held
to be “wholly incompatible with the peace, tranquility and progress
that all citizens have a right to enjoy.” This legislation required
prospective teachers to fill out a long questionnaire designed to uncover
the slightest deviation from complete racial orthodoxy. The
questions asked included:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Do you belong to the NAACP? Does any member of your immediate family
belong to the NAACP? Do you support the NAACP in any way (money or
attendance at meetings)?</p>

<p>Do you favor integration of races in schools? Are you satisfied with your
work and the schools as they are now maintained? If yes, comment on back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Do you feel that you would be happy in an integrated school system, knowing
that the parents and students do not favor this system? (Give reasons for your
answer)</p>

<p>Do you feel that an integrated school system would better fit the colored
race for their life’s work? (Give reasons for your answer)</p>

<p>Do you feel that the parents of your school know that no public schools
will be operated if they are integrated? Do you believe in the aims of the
NAACP?<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The 1956 legislature also authorized the investigation of NAACP
activities at Orangeburg state college.</p>

<p>Several other anti-NAACP measures were introduced but failed of
passage. These followed the pernicious tactic of linking the NAACP
with the Klan. Included was a proposal to deny tax exempt status
to “any building of public worship” used as a meeting place by the
Communist party or the NAACP. Another would have required all
state officials and employes to declare by oath that they belonged
neither to the NAACP nor the Ku Klux Klan. Declared the latter
proposal: “The dangerous policies and doctrines of these despicable
organizations constitute a danger to the health, morals, safety and
general welfare of citizens in the state.”<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>The legislature’s preoccupation with such measures was generally
criticized by the press of the state. The <cite>Morning News</cite> questioned
the reasonableness, fairness and justness of the anti-NAACP bills and
compared them to the pattern of “McCarthyism.” “Bills of this
kind,” wrote O’Dowd, “are seldom given a chance of passage—even
by the authors. They are written and introduced as a grandstand
play for the folks back home. They may serve to make the author
look like the champion of white Protestantism to some of the more
rabid of his supporters; but the bills also make the legislature look
pretty silly and immature.” On another occasion the same paper
declared that “speeches and resolutions against the Supreme Court and
the NAACP” had replaced “home, mother, God and country in South
Carolina political circles.” The 1956 session of the legislature, chided
O’Dowd, would possibly be renowned for “turning its back on positive
progress and dedicating its efforts to blind blows against the Supreme
Court and the NAACP.”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> In agreement the <cite>Independent</cite> stated that
the 1956 legislature showed “signs of turning into a mad scramble”
to see who could introduce the most “‘segregation’ bills.” The low-country
Walterboro <cite>Press and Standard</cite> believed that “some politicians
are more interested in ‘cashing in’ politically on the [segregation]
issue and prolonging it than in establishing a steady, determined
course of action that will in fact preserve both segregation and the
fundamental freedoms in South Carolina.”<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> The <cite>Record</cite> also questioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the wisdom of anti-NAACP measures which might serve only
to drive the organization underground or to replace it with “some
other apparently less sinister group.”<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> was more sympathetic especially in the light
of the purpose for which the measures were designed. It noted that</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Georgia is taking steps to combat race bias among its public school teachers.
By banning membership in the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, Atty. Gen. [Eugene] Cook has incurred the wrath of NAACP
and other race spokesmen.</p>

<p>The same kind of fuss was made over attempts to root communists and subversives
out of government jobs. “Interference with individual freedom” is the
battle cry.</p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> is a firm believer in individual freedom. For that
reason we do not believe that teachers should belong to the NAACP or any
other militant group. Such membership destroys freedom to teach the unbiased
truth.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The Charleston paper, however, would not achieve its objectives
by a law barring NAACP members from state employment. It suggested
instead that the matter be handled on the local level. Local
school boards knew best which teachers were “spreading the NAACP
line. Such teachers should be discharged, firmly but with as little
fuss as possible. Membership in the NAACP or any similar organization
dedicated to upsetting customs and laws of our state should
be grounds for dismissal.”<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>In the contest to see who could introduce the most segregation bills,
Representative John Calhoun Hart of Union County won handily.
This rumple-haired legislative fire-brand introduced separately or in
conjunction with others the bill to remove tax exemptions from
churches used as meeting places for the Communist party or the
NAACP (not passed); the bill to require all public officials and employes
to take an anti-NAACP and anti-Ku Klux Klan oath (not
passed); a resolution asking that the legislature condemn Vice-President
Richard M. Nixon “in the strongest manner possible” for the
Vice-President’s resort “to the vilest and lowest politics imaginable”
in “arousing and causing dissension among the races” (not passed);
a resolution asking President Eisenhower to restore segregation in
the armed forces (passed); a bill to prohibit Union County schools
from belonging to any educational association approving of racially
integrated schools (passed); a bill to prohibit state agencies and institutions
from buying from firms which sponsored interracial television
or radio programs (not passed); the resolution asking that
the NAACP be declared a subversive organization by the federal
government (passed); and a resolution urging the state’s delegation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
to the 1956 Democratic national convention to seek restoration of the
⅔ rule for nomination of candidates (passed).<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>Representative Hart became positively splenetic upon learning that
Clarence Mitchell, the Washington NAACP official, had used the
white waiting room at the Florence train station. Mitchell was arrested
for his action but Florence authorities prudently did not press
the case. For such seeming pusillanimity Representative Hart blasted
Florence officials. He deplored “the jelly fish manner in which they
handled Clarence Mitchell’s flagrant violation of South Carolina
segregation customs.” The teacher-legislator then indicated how he
would educate Mitchell:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Bashing Mitchell’s head would have had a highly salutary effect on integration
psychology in the Florence area....</p>

<p>We must have a showdown sooner or later and it is doubtful that a better
opportunity will ever present itself. A few cracked heads here and there could
easily avert bloodshed on a large scale later on.... There’s more law and order
in a South Carolina night-stick than in sociological U. S. Supreme Court opinion.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>One of the least laudable and most farcical of the legislature’s actions
was its lapse into book censorship. It arose from discovery that a
novel, <cite>The Swimming Hole</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> written for eight to twelve year olds,
was being circulated throughout South Carolina by the State Library
Board. The following summary from the <cite>Morning News</cite> indicates the
extent of the book’s threat to the South Carolina segregation customs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The story opens with three little white boys and a Negro boy calling at the
home of Larry, another Negro child, to ask him to go swimming with them.
Larry’s mother invites the boys in, gives them each an apple and warns them not
to go in the water for a while after eating.</p>

<p>The boys troop off toward the swimming hole with one of the Negroes leading
the way in what apparently is a game of “Follow the leader.”</p>

<p>Upon reaching the swimming hole, the children disrobe together and the next
page shows one of the Negro boys first in the swim as another Negro child holds
one of the white boys off the diving board. In the background, several other
Negroes are mingled among the white boys.</p>

<p>After several hours of swimming, they dress together and start home. Larry
spots a new white boy in the neighborhood, and the next day they invite the new
boy to join them in the swimming hole.</p>

<p>Steve, the new boy, isn’t a very good swimmer so he sits all day in his trunks
in the sun and acquires a bright red sunburn. When the boys are dressing to
go home, Larry finds his clothing tied in knots. Bob, the other Negro boy, makes
a similar discovery.</p>

<p>Steve admits the prank, because “I don’t want to play with anyone who’s
colored.” Whereupon Steve turns his glowing red back on them all and starts
home.</p>

<p>Larry suggests they all tell Steve the next day they “don’t want to play with
anyone the color you are.” The others agree “that’s a good idea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>The plan is carried out the next day and the boys leave Steve contemplating
his sunburned reflection in a store window. Apparently after some soul searching,
Steve goes to the swimming hole and tells Larry, “I won’t tie your clothes
again” because “it doesn’t matter what color people are.”</p>

<p>“Of course it doesn’t,” Larry tells him. “Come on in the water. I’ll teach you
to swim.”</p>

<p>The last page concludes, “They all had a wonderful time together.”</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Discovery of the book in a state library evoked immediate and
outspoken criticism.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The head of the State Library Board argued
that the book was not aimed at integration, but designed to point out
that “human values are not to be judged by physical differences.”
Nevertheless, a resolution was introduced in the state legislature by
Representatives J. Henry Stuckey of Williamsburg County and Albert
W. Watson of Richland County to secure removal of the book and
to prevent recurrence of similar situations in the future. Books like
<cite>The Swimming Hole</cite>, according to the resolution, were “antagonistic
and inimical to the traditions and customs of our state,” and “serve
no constructive educational purpose but rather tend to confuse and
warp the thinking of our young children.”</p>

<p>Though calmer heads opposed the resolution, it was approved.
Charges of “book burning” and “Hitler tactics” were heard on the floor
of the legislature. Representative William H. Grimball, Jr., of Charleston
urged the House to “let reason combat whatever thoughts are in
books ... in any free democracy you ought to be able to expound
anything you want.” To another lowcountry representative, Edward
Huguenin of Jasper, the resolution represented a “ridiculous extreme.”
Supporting the measure, Representative John M. Horlbeck of Charleston
and Representative John T. Gentry of Pickens declared that the
question was not one of “literary freedom” but of asserting the “attitude
of the General Assembly.”</p>

<p>Press reaction was generally unfavorable to this censorship. The
<cite>Record</cite> said that it was “dangerous business when government gets
into the field of censorship of literature, business ‘antagonistic and
inimical’ to the traditions and customs of South Carolina.” Americans
had always thought that bad ideas could be controverted by good
ideas. The <cite>Record</cite> urged South Carolina “to leave censorship to
Russia and to Boston.” But the <cite>News and Courier</cite> was sympathetic.
While conceding that “books expressing all viewpoints should be
available for adults,” the Charleston paper declared,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>But on the children’s shelves, it seems to us, propaganda should be confined
to such wholesome generalities as “good is better than evil,” “crime doesn’t pay,”
“be kind to people and animals,” and “an industrious child gets more done than
a lazy one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
... And there is no need to stand up for a book that tries by subtle propaganda
to make the South’s racial customs appear to be hateful and wicked.</p>

<p>Although a cursory perusal of the anti-integration bills adopted by
the 1955 and 1956 sessions of the general assembly might infer that
the legislators had exhausted the possibilities along this line, such
was by no means the case. The 1957 session was only slightly less
productive than that of 1956. In attempting to plug by legislative
fiat every possible hole in the segregation dike the solons in 1957
ranged from the petty and silly to the dangerous and ridiculous.</p>

<p>Falling into the first category were the attempt to ban the movie
<cite>Island in the Sun</cite> and the proposal to require all blood banks to label
blood White or Colored. The movie is an adaptation of Alec Waugh’s
novel <cite>Island in the Sun</cite> involving love affairs between interracial
couples. Though the cinema version of the story soft-pedals its amatory
aspects to the point that not a single interracial kiss takes place
on the screen, Representative John Calhoun Hart described it as “a
sickening, repulsive, indecent spectacle to which no one in this state
should be exposed or subjected.” The Union County lawmaker introduced
a bill which declared that the movie “openly” advocated “breaking
the miscegenation section of the state constitution” and charged
the movie industry with “attempting to foster moral depravity by
condoning the mixing of the races.” The bill would have fined any
theater showing the film $5,000. Hart’s effort to save “the young
people of the world” came to naught. Even the <cite>News and Courier</cite>
condemned it as censorship.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Of a similar nature was the bill offered by <abbr title="Representative">Rep.</abbr> George Sam Harrell
of Florence County which would have required that blood banks label
all stored blood “White” or “Colored.” <abbr title="Representative">Rep.</abbr> Harrell decried the fact
that since 1951 blood had not been labeled by race. He said Negro
and white blood was now put on a desk and “you come along and they
will shoot” Negro “blood in your veins.” To his colleagues in the
House, he declared, “I don’t want any ... [Negro] blood in me and
I don’t intend to have any.” The bill, which passed the House but
not the Senate, carried provisions for $100 fine or 30 days in jail or
both for violators.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>Potentially the most dangerous of the many pro-segregation measures
was a recommendation by the Gressette Committee, subsequently
enacted by the legislature, that the governor be given almost dictatorial
injunctive police and military power “to prevent violence or
threats of violence.” Under provisions of the bill the governor can
“by proclamation declare that a danger exists.” Then to “cope with
such danger” he may enjoin any acts or planned acts by individuals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
associations or corporations, call in all state, county and local law
officers and call out the state militia “to maintain peace and good
order.” There was surprisingly little reaction to this proposal. Said
the <cite>News and Courier</cite>: “If they are used with discretion, such police
powers ... may be an effective method of combatting federal discrimination
against South Carolina.”<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>The 1957 general assembly also considered many other pro-segregation
measures: a resolution creating a group similar to the State
Sovereignty Commission of Mississippi to acquaint non-Southerners
with the South Carolina position on racial segregation (not passed);
a resolution by <abbr title="Representative">Rep.</abbr> Hart to impeach six of the nine justices of the
Supreme Court (not passed); an anti-barratry law aimed at the
NAACP (passed); and a bill repealing the 1956 statute which forbade
public employment to NAACP members and the enacting of a new
requirement that merely provided that all prospective employes list
those organizations to which they belong (passed).<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> This last law was
the result of a suit brought by a group of Elloree Negro teachers who
refused to answer a questionnaire under the 1956 law. As a result of
the new law the federal courts refused to hear the suit brought by the
teachers.</p>

<p>In addition to these measures <abbr title="Representative">Rep.</abbr> Hart introduced still another
to strengthen the position of South Carolina in its fight for states
rights. Reaching a new nadir, this proposal, which was not adopted,
declared that: “No executive order or directive of the President, and
no act or resolution of the Congress, and no judicial decision or construction
of the Supreme or any inferior Court, and no treaty with
any foreign power or international agreement of the United States
in conflict with, or diminishment of, or derogatory to the powers not
delegated to the United States and reserved to the States respectively
or the people, shall become effective as law in this State, except through
enactment only by the General Assembly pursuant to the Constitution
of the State of South Carolina, and otherwise the same shall be null
and void and of no effect in this state.”<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>Use of official authority to coerce public school officials in maintaining
the segregation line intact has been a comparatively easy matter.
To move against private educational institutions which served as focal
points of disaffection or threatened to lower the segregation barrier is
more difficult. One such recent effort by Governor Timmerman and
a compliant State Board of Education bared a vicious form of official
infighting.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1957 rumor bruited around the campus of
Allen University, an African Methodist Episcopal Church school in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Columbia, that the Governor’s office had warned the institution’s recently
inaugurated president, the Reverend Frank Veal, that he would
have to dismiss three professors from the faculty or face the consequences.
The men proscribed were Professors John G. Rideout, chairman
of the division of humanities; Edwin Hoffman, chairman of the
division of education; and Forrest O. Wiggins of the department of
philosophy. All were holders of doctorates from leading American
universities and Rideout had been a Rhodes scholar. Rideout and
Hoffman are white and Wiggins a Negro. While no specific charges
were made against the men insofar as their professional competency
was concerned—it is generally agreed by the Allen students that
they are among the most effective teachers on the faculty—much was
made of the fact that the names of Wiggins and Rideout were in the
files of the United States House of Representatives Un-American Activities
Committee.</p>

<p>President Veal, betraying an unprofessional sensitivity to academic
procedures, wilted under the pressure and without consulting the members
of Allen’s board of trustees wrote letters to the three men in
question demanding their resignations “for the good of the University.”
But Rideout, Hoffman and Wiggins would not resign and to confuse
matters further, the board of trustees not only refused to back Veal
but also announced that the three professors would continue on as
members of the faculty. A few days later, however, Veal reportedly
declared that his demand for the resignations of the three men still
stood and that they were in effect being given a year’s dismissal notice.
Although the Columbia press gave prominent headlines to Veal’s statement,
there was no indication that the board of trustees agreed with
it. But just on the eve of the new academic year Veal replaced Hoffman
as chairman of the division of education with Dr. Sylvia Swinton,
a former Negro field supervisor for the State Department of Education.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>A few weeks later Allen again bounced back into the news headlines
with the announcement that five Hungarian refugees would be enrolled
at the University. Their admission would constitute the first modern
break-through in South Carolina’s segregation wall. And, as State
Attorney General T. C. Callison was obliged to acknowledge, the worst
part of the situation was that although it was “against public policy”
to integrate Negroes and whites in educational institutions, there was
“no law in South Carolina to reach” Allen, a private and church school.
Actually, only one of the five Hungarian “freedom fighters,” Andre
Toth, enrolled at Allen when its fall term opened.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>But the Governor and his advisors on the State Board of Education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
still held a trump card to play. If Allen could not be dealt with directly,
it could be struck a low blow punch through withdrawal of
official approval of the University for teacher training. Accordingly,
the State Board of Education, on which the Governor sits as an ex
officio member, on September 9th sent notice to Allen that its graduates
would have teacher certification withheld “until such time as the
Board may determine that it is in the public interest to grant approval.”
The Board did not specify what if anything was wrong with the
education courses offered at Allen, courses that hitherto had had its
approval.</p>

<p>President Veal was conveniently out of Columbia, but Allen board
of trustees president, Bishop I. H. Bonner, cautiously took up the
gauntlet. To the consternation of several administrative officials at
the University of South Carolina, the Bishop opined that Allen’s students
requiring teacher certification would undoubtedly seek admission
to the University and other white state-supported institutions of higher
learning.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Should such applicants be admitted to these schools by
Federal court order, resort to which would, of course, be imperative,
state law would oblige the schools to close.</p>

<p>The nadir of official hypocrisy came with the announcement of the
State Board of Education following its September 20th meeting, that
it was seeking to help Allen solve its internal problems. At the same
meeting a “bi-racial” committee consisting of six white members and
one Negro, B. C. Turner, president of the State college for Negroes at
Orangeburg, was appointed to review applications for teacher training
courses in South Carolina’s private and public universities and
colleges.</p>

<p>Crocodile tears were copiously shed by “some state officials” over
“the plight of Dr. Veal” in light of his failure to rid his faculty of
three objectionable professors. These same persons allegedly asked
how, for instance, the State Board of Education could approve a teacher
training course at an institution whose academic head desired to dismiss
members of his faculty but could not do so because of the opposition
of his board of trustees. The logic of the state officials was that
if the president of an approved teacher training institution didn’t want
certain instructors because of lack of faith in them, then the state
could not accept a student who received certification for his work under
such a professor.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>So utterly gross were the actions of the Governor and the State
Board of Education that there was embarrassingly little discussion of
the affair in the editorial columns of the state’s press. Those few
papers that discussed the Allen situation either printed without comment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the decision of the Board of Education to withdraw accreditation
or looked askance upon it. The Florence <cite>Morning News</cite>, for
example, found the “handling of the Allen case unfortunate” particularly
in the light of the secrecy involved, the shortage of qualified
Negro teachers, the encouragement that it would give to Negroes to
apply to the University of South Carolina and the lack of data supplied
to Allen officials as to the reasons for the Board’s actions.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The Allen situation stood at a standstill until mid-December with
neither the University officials nor the State Board of Education changing
their positions. But on December 17th, Bishop Bonner met with
the Governor in the latter’s office, at his own request so he said, for
a “cordial” talk and the fat was again in the fire. According to
Bonner, Timmerman maintained that the controversy over the three
professors was “non-political” and “non-racial” and then proceeded
to tell him “what was wrong.” Just what was wrong the Bishop did
not reveal.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>Two days later Bishop Bonner notified Hoffman, Rideout, and
Wiggins that he would recommend their dismissal when the trustees’
board of control would be called for a special meeting on January 10,
1958. He further informed them that they would receive their salaries
for the remainder of the year if they resigned and departed quietly
but that if they fought their dismissals, they would get nothing. The
professors declined to take any action pending the meeting of the
trustees on January 10th.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the American Association of University Professors entered
into the picture. General Secretary of the Association Dr.
Robert K. Carr wired Governor Timmerman requesting that he provide
the AAUP with information regarding the grounds on which the
State Board of Education had voted to withhold teacher accreditation
approval of Allen graduates. Carr at the same time told reporters
that his organization viewed with alarm the apparent relationship of
the question of academic tenure at Allen with that of political interference
“with the internal operations of private institutions.” “We
are concerned,” he said, “lest there be direct connection between the
two matters—the dismissal of the faculty members and the withholding
of teacher certificates.” The AAUP, he added, would support the
professors to the hilt. Carr was satisfied that the presence of the
Hungarian white student on the Allen campus was in no way related
to the certification question.</p>

<p>Timmerman’s response to Carr’s request was completely in character.
He told the AAUP that the Allen affair was none of its business.
“Our state is concerned with protecting all of its people,” the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
governor wired Carr, “and your authority to question its official actions
is without recognition. The resolution [of the State Board of Education]
speaks for itself.”</p>

<p>Carr expressed dismay at the brusque tone of the governor’s telegram.
“Governor Timmerman’s reaction is most unfortunate,” he declared.
“Our queries are usually received by state officials and institutions
respectfully and answered if possible.” For his part Timmerman,
clearly annoyed, replied that Carr’s “political whimpering” confirmed
his suspicion as to the motive behind the former’s telegram. Timmerman
said that Carr should “seek the answer to his questions from his
own files” thus implying that prejudicial information against the three
professors was at the disposal of the AAUP.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>The show-down on the Allen affair came at the board of trustees
meeting on January 10th and the results gratified all persons who still
believe in academic freedom. Bishop Bonner, who probably hoped
to dominate the meeting, found the spotlight taken away from him by
Dr. R. A. Mance, a former Columbia physician who lives in Washington,
D.C. Mance, a member of the Allen Board of Trustees, is also
treasurer of the national African Methodist Episcopal Church. When
Mance spoke out in defense of the three professors, those present at
the meeting which was open to the public were very much aware that
he was voicing the sentiments of the national church organization on
which Allen heavily depends.</p>

<p>Bishop Bonner tried to defend his demand for the ouster of Wiggins,
Rideout and Hoffman in the face of an audience which booed him
when he said that Governor Timmerman impressed him as being “a
very fine man.” According to Bonner, who was demonstrably angry
at the hostile audience, Timmerman had told him that the State Board
of Education believed “that the three men could not possibly exert a
good influence on the university in view of their refusal to resign at
the request of the president following the recommendation by the dean
of the faculty.” The Bishop, disregarding all questions of intimidation
and of civil rights, based his position squarely on the ground that
the most important thing for Allen to consider was the certification
of its graduates by the state.</p>

<p>In the face of needling questions by Dr. Mance and other trustees,
the Bishop turned to President Veal for support. It was on Veal’s
request, according to Bonner, that the meeting had been called. But
here the Bishop was in for a rude awakening as Veal, not unmindful
that an investigation committee from the national AME church was
present at the meeting, suddenly announced that he would definitely
not recommend dismissal of the three professors “at this time.” Veal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
who could hardly deny that he had asked for the resignations of
Rideout, Wiggins, and Hoffman, said that any decision either to retain
or to dismiss them would be arrived at according to academic procedures.
Bonner, left out on a limb, accused Veal of having “backed
out” on him. The meeting broke up without any action being taken
and with the parting comment of Bishop Bonner that failure to dismiss
the three controversial professors “could mean death to Allen
University.” But Allen’s student body clearly did not share Bonner’s
pessimism. A few hours after the meeting had adjourned nearly three
hundred students gathered in front of Veal’s home and serenaded him.
For the first time in months the harassed president found himself
genuinely popular amongst the students.</p>

<p>In the Allen battle, which as the trustee Reverend F. C. James of
Sumter pointed out “affects every private institution in America” as
well as the issues of “civil liberties and civil rights,” the old “Uncle
Tom” leadership, as personified in Bishop Bonner and his supporters,
went down to defeat before the new generation of American Negroes.
Whether the defeat will be thorough and permanent, only the future
will tell. But administrators of private colleges throughout America
owe a debt of gratitude to the courageous stand taken by the African
Methodist Episcopal Church in the face of political intimidation.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>On January 15 Governor Timmerman officially spelled out to the
people of South Carolina why the State Board of Education had withdrawn
its approval of Allen for teacher training. In his annual message
to the state legislature he warned of the “communist menace” in
South Carolina [as of 1951 the Federal Bureau of Investigation could
count only seventeen alleged Communists in the State!] and pointed
his finger directly at Allen as a center of possible subversion. Borrowing
a trick from the late senator from Wisconsin, the chief executive
proceeded to read to the members of the legislature the “party-line”
records of the three Allen professors; he mentioned none of them
by name. The records, he said, had been procured from administration
officials at Allen and from “other” sources of information [the files
of the Un-American Activities Committee supplied through the office
of Congressman John Riley]. According to the Governor, the chairman
of the board of trustees at Allen, Bishop Bonner, was anxious to
protect the University’s student body from the noxious influences of
“atheism” and “communism” and it was for this reason that he had
requested the resignations of the three professors. The State Board
of Education was seeking to cooperate with Allen officials toward this
end.</p>

<p>Having raised the spectre of communism and its threat to the Palmetto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
State, Timmerman then suggested a means of coping with the
problem, one not very original, to be sure. He recommended establishment
of a “permanent legislative committee to investigate communist
activities in our state.” In addition, the Governor urged that
“consideration be given to the establishment of more realistic requirements
for admission to teach in state-supported institutions.” Applicants
should be screened more closely before they were employed.
Concluding on the following note Timmerman declared: “When academic
freedom supersedes loyalty to one’s country, to one’s state and
to our trust in God, it becomes an instrumentality of treason and profanes
the faith of our nation.”<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Senator Gressette of the state’s committee to preserve educational
segregation lauded the Governor’s recommendation for a new minor
league Un-American Activities Committee. So did other members of
the legislature. But the three Allen professors in a statement to the
radio and press services blasted the Governor. “The fact of the matter
is—and Governor Timmerman knows it well—the real need here in
South Carolina is the achievement of American democracy for all the
state’s citizens rather than a committee to investigate so-called communistic
activities.” The three professors, all church members, also
struck back at the Chief Executive’s atheist innuendo. “It comes with
ill grace,” they asserted, “for the Governor to question the religious
faith of others when he himself so openly repudiates the fundamental
teaching of Him who died that all men might dwell together as brothers.”
Nor did they think that Timmerman could pose as the shield
and defender of the Constitution. “It ill becomes a Governor who
spends so much of his time repudiating the Constitution of our country
and endeavoring to undermine the highest court of the land to pass
upon the patriotism of other Americans. If belief in racial segregation
is to be made the definition of loyalty, the vast majority of Americans
become disloyal in the eyes of Governor Timmerman.”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>On the same day that the Governor was reaffirming his determination
to maintain segregation in South Carolina, eleven Allen students appeared
on the campus of the University of South Carolina seeking
application blanks to permit them to take the University’s entrance
examinations. They were turned away by the director of the University’s
examination and counseling service who explained that his
hands were tied by state law. “According to the orders under which
we operate,” he told the students, “I cannot examine you and there
is no purpose in supplying you with applications.” Six days later a
group of four students from Benedict College, another Negro institution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
in Columbia, also applied for examination application blanks and
were similarly rebuffed.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>No effort was made to molest the Negroes when they were on the
University of South Carolina campus, though one USC student is said
to have leaned out a window and shouted, “Here come the niggers.”
During the evening, however, a cross was burned on the University’s
athletic field and an effigy of a Negro was hung up on the campus.
Telephone calls were received at Allen threatening the University with
bombings unless the Negro students desisted in their efforts to enter
the University of South Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>Governor Timmerman’s ill-tempered and ill-conceived pressure on
Allen opened the door for the very type of law suit that officials of
white state-supported universities have been dreading since 1954.
The Allen applicants, four of them ministers, indicated that they would
resort to “legal steps” to gain admission. “We plan to see this thing
through,” said one of their spokesmen. “We all feel that Negroes
have been ostracized by being kept out of the University and our cups
are just about to run over.”<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Only the future can tell, of course, what Governor Timmerman
triggered off in his effort to rid Rideout, Wiggins and Hoffman from
the Allen faculty. The question of admission of Negroes to white
state-supported universities had to be faced sooner or later, but officials
of the latter would have preferred to face it later. But to explain
Timmerman’s attitude toward the three professors is something else
again. The “communist” issue was convenient, if a bit dated, but
those who have closely followed the segregation question in South
Carolina since the Supreme Court decision of 1954 are inclined to believe
that the reason is less ideological than local.</p>

<p>Since the purge of the state Negro college at Orangeburg—the institution
is on probation with accreditation agencies because it does not
have a sufficient number of holders of the Ph.D. degree on its faculty—Allen
has been the chief center for Negro militancy in South Carolina.
The three professors who have been the target of official attack have
been prominent amongst those on the campus who have urged the
University’s students to assert their rights, including the right to sit
where they please on city buses. In all of the newspaper accounts
of the Allen affair, these facts have not been mentioned, but it is suggested
here that they have been governing. Also in the new administration
of President Veal and in the person of Bishop Bonner, state
authorities were quick to detect a lack of militancy present in their
predecessors. It would appear that they have sought to exploit this
“softness” and to repeat their disgraceful performance at Orangeburg.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
But the Allen trustees were made of sterner stuff than the Governor
and the State Board of Education had supposed.</p>

<p>The Governor’s frustration was compounded by temporary failure to
bring about the dismissal of three white faculty members from Benedict
College, a Negro Baptist institution located directly across the street
from Allen. In a special message to the General Assembly on January
29, Timmerman cited from the files of the House Un-American Activities
Committee the records of three Benedict professors. He also told
the legislators that Dr. J. A. Bacoats, president of Benedict and highly
respected by both whites and Negroes throughout the state, had delivered
a speech in 1941 at a “Protestantism Answers Hate” dinner-forum
allegedly sponsored by a “communist-front publication.”<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>Bacoats and two of the three professors cited, Dr. Lewis Smith and
Dr. J. Spencer Kennard, answered the Governor in statements to the
press. The former declared: “I have never been a communist nor held
membership in the Communist Party. And as I see it from where I now
stand, I shall never be a member of the Communist Party.” Smith, a
professor of English, said he had no intention of resigning and that he
was being attacked “by the same forces that would keep the Negro
people from achieving full equality.” Kennard, a Baptist minister and
a member of the Benedict history department, asserted that the Governor
had “set out deliberately to smear the character of a man who
devoted his entire life to serving the Master.”<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>The governor’s attack on Benedict was successful only in uniting the
Negro community in defense of the College (far more so than had been
true of the Allen affair) and in alarming white conservatives. The Inter-Denominational
Ministerial Alliance of Columbia (Negro), criticizing
the Governor’s proposal for a state Un-American Activities committee,
held that such a group would be a “fascist gestapo” and threaten Negro
academic freedom. It also questioned the very legality of such a committee
in the light of recent Supreme Court decisions. Likewise, John
H. McCray, chairman of the South Carolina Progressive Democrats,
said: “Negro leadership in South Carolina has maintained an eternal
and vigorous alert against influence of communism among its people....”
And from R. Beverley Herbert, a conservative white attorney
of Columbia, came the warning against assuming that men were
communists because of past association with left-wing organizations.
But the crowning blow came when Benedict’s board of trustees, which
includes several white men, among them Dr. Paul Wheeler, a well
known clergyman; Dr. R. Archie Ellis, pastor of the Columbia First
Baptist Church and B. M. Edwards, a prominent South Carolina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
banker, issued a public statement completely exonerating President
Bacoats and the three faculty members.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>White South Carolinians undoubtedly consider public education to
be the key issue in the Negroes’ drive for racial equality. Consequently
other aspects of the question have received less consideration
in discussions relating to the pros and cons of integration. Important
developments, however, have been occurring in other areas where attempts
at integration are being made, e.g. the armed forces, city buses,
and state operated recreation parks.</p>

<p>South Carolina officials can do little more than decry integration in
the nation’s armed forces. By the time the Supreme Court gave its
initial school desegregation ruling, integration in the armed services
had progressed to a point where it had become an accepted fact to
all except the most extreme die-hards. Nevertheless Governor Timmerman
lodged a futile protest with the National Security Council in
late 1955. Referring to statements by military leaders expressing
concern over low reenlistment rates among military personnel, the
Governor wrote: “So long as our basic training installations are used
as sociological camps for compulsory racial mixing, it is reasonable
to expect a continued lack of voluntary enlistments, and a continued
lessening of morale and <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> in our armed forces. The
officials of no other country in the world are so naive as to employ
racial integration among military personnel.” Commenting on the
Governor’s letter the <cite>News and Courier</cite> asked editorially: “Is it simply
a coincidence that, at about the same time the government mixed the
races in the armed forces, enlistments started to sag?” Without
answering its question, the Charleston paper continued: “If integration
has hurt enlistments and morale, then it follows that integration has
harmed national defense.... Gov. Timmerman has courageously
brought the matter out into the open.”<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>In 1956 the general assembly in its onslaught on all phases of integration
passed a resolution urging President Eisenhower to “restore
segregation of the races in the armed forces of this country which
would result in a return of the high morale, efficiency and <i lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i> which our armed forces have always heretofore enjoyed.”<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> The
resolution evoked no response in Washington.</p>

<p>Once the assault on armed forces integration had begun, others
joined in. From The Citadel, the military college of South Carolina,
came a booming verbal salvo from President Mark Clark, former
United Nations Commander in the Far East. “I did not feel that we
should integrate then [in 1950 when the Army order was placed in
effect] and I do not think so now,” said the transplanted general from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
the North. “I looked at integration strictly as a military problem,
not from the sociological standpoint.... I wanted the best fighting
unit possible ... politics or no politics.”<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>South Carolina Negroes, following the lead set in Montgomery,
Alabama, have endeavored to bring about invalidation of both state
and local Jim Crow laws in the field of bus segregation. In this connection
Sarah Mae Flemming of Columbia instituted suit against the
South Carolina Electric and Gas Company, operators of the city bus
system of Columbia, asking $25,000 for alleged violations of her civil
rights. She charged that a bus driver had forcibly required her to
go to the rear of a city bus in conformity with the South Carolina
law. In the federal district court Judge Timmerman dismissed Miss
Flemming’s suit on the ground that the 1896 decision upholding separate
but equal facilities in transportation was still in effect and had not
been overruled by the school cases of 1954. (There was a curious
lack of logic in Judge Timmerman’s position since for years Southerners
had defended segregation in the public school on the basis of the
<cite>Plessy v. Ferguson</cite> ruling which upheld the separate but equal doctrine
in transportation.) This decision was appealed and reversed by
the federal circuit court presided over by Judge John J. Parker. In
an action which the <cite>Record</cite> considered “brusque arrogance,” the Supreme
Court refused to hear the appeal of the South Carolina Electric
and Gas Company thus in effect upholding the circuit court decision.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>The practical effect of this decision on South Carolina bus segregation
has been nil. Nowhere have traditional patterns of segregation
ended. Attorney General T. C. Callison considered the Supreme
Court’s action in this case “another unwarranted invasion of state and
municipal rights.” In early 1956 the state legislature resolved that
it was “unalterably opposed to the mixing of the races on common
carriers” and would “tolerate no violation of the laws of this State
relating to the separation of the races on common carriers.” The
<cite>News and Courier</cite>, strangely enough, foresaw no drastic results if bus
segregation were ended. However, it believed that “as a practical
matter, they [Negroes] suffer no hardship by observing regulations
that reflect prevailing customs of the community. Even if the laws
were removed from the books, good manners call for respect of fellow
passengers’ preferences.”<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Editor Waring’s paper made no comment
on the obligation of whites to respect the preference of their
Negro fellow passengers.</p>

<p>In its own enveloping attack on the segregation front South Carolina’s
Negro leadership has struck at the state operated recreation
parks. In 1955 the State of South Carolina maintained twenty-one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
recreation parks, one of which was operated exclusively for Negroes.
Of the other twenty, four had separate areas reserved for Negroes.
In view of such obvious discrimination, Negroes brought suit to have
Edisto Beach State Park opened for all South Carolinians without
regard to race or color. In answering this suit the state attorney
general’s office presented a brief before the federal district court which
declared that “due to the natural inclination of each race at this time
to associate and engage in recreation and social activities with members
of its own race, and to the present natural, historical, cultural
and deep-rooted mental attitudes and feelings of each race against the
social and sexual mixing of the races, there exists potential and definite
dangers of unpleasantries, social friction, breaches of the peace
and other events leading to riot and bloodshed, which will surely result
from an enforced mixing of the races at such a park.”<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>In the light of recent federal court decisions, state officials realized
that such arguments would carry little weight in federal courts. Therefore
in 1956, precluding a federal court order on the case, the state
legislature passed a resolution closing Edisto Beach State Park to both
white and colored. The park remains closed, “a monument,” said the
Columbia <cite>State</cite>, to the “vindictiveness” of race agitators.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>With actions such as these the sovereign state of South Carolina
has combatted the “alien ideas” of racial equality and equal rights
for all men.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER <abbr title="Eight">VIII</abbr></h4>
<h3>POLITICS AND SEGREGATION</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent10 unindent">In all parts of the Republic, thoughtful people are
talking about realignment of political parties. On
many issues, including appeal to bloc-voting Negroes
in the big cities, the Republicans and the Democrats
have grown too much alike. The South can split
them by voting against both and setting up a climate
for new political alliances.—<cite>News and Courier</cite></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Following the Supreme Court’s desegregation decision, politics have
reflected South Carolina’s intense preoccupation with the integration
issue. The Negro, of course, has always been an important factor
in the state’s politics. However since the New Deal period the national
political parties and the federal government have no longer
been content to allow the white South to handle the race issue without
“interference.” Reflecting the sentiment of Northern liberal elements,
they have been insistent on the extension of civil rights to
Negroes in the South. This fact, increasingly important since World
War <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, has been the principal cause for the reaction against the national
Democratic Party in South Carolina in the presidential elections
of 1948, 1952 and 1956. Political factions were unable to solve their
differences within one party and, at least on the level of presidential
elections, rival groups emerged to challenge the supremacy of the
regular Democratic Party. They did not contest that party’s hold on
other levels.</p>

<p>In state wide elections of 1954-1956 the race issue transcended all
others with but one important exception, the J. Strom Thurmond-Edgar
Brown senatorial election of 1954. Both rabid segregationists and
“liberals” criticized this concentration on race. The <cite>News and Courier</cite>
believed the constant political agitation of “the race issue” since the
Supreme Court decision had upset “an era of good will, harmony and
progress” in race relations in the South. “Tension ... and danger of
civil disturbance” had replaced the previous racial harmony. It
blamed “a small militant group of white and Negro radicals” who had
revived an issue which Southern politicians had “for years” kept out
of the political arena. On the other hand David D. Carroll of Bennettsville,
risking his “freedom from ‘assault and arson,’” accused
“inter-state lynch-leaders” of stirring up the issue for private political
gain. “Thus a truth-starved South,” he said, “tragically believes that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
today’s issue is a spontaneous racial crisis, never suspecting its
partial origin in sinister politics.”<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Appeals to keep the segregation issue out of politics have gone unheeded.
Its political worth is too great to be ignored. Segregation
was “as surefire as political fuel as home, church, mother, and Wade
Hampton,” stated the <cite>Independent</cite>. As a consequence, the state suffered
from “crack pot oratory and poorly considered prosecutions
and impractical laws” at a time when “imponderable, quiet, reserved,
never relenting, never compromising resistance” was needed.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>While the full import of the segregation decisions of the Supreme
Court was not fully realized in state politics until the presidential
campaign of 1956, the gubernatorial election of 1954 provided a good
example of the use to which South Carolina politicians put the race
issue. In that election Lieutenant Governor George Bell Timmerman
Jr. opposed Lester Bates, a Columbia businessman and a novice whose
political experience was limited to service on the Columbia City
Council. Timmerman, the successful candidate, developed two campaign
themes—the race issue and Bates’ alleged business malpractices.
In a series of unproven charges, the Lieutenant Governor made good
use of smear techniques. On May 26, a few days after the Supreme
Court’s original decision, Timmerman charged Bates with “sleeping
in the same political bed” with South Carolina NAACP officials. He
declared that the school segregation problem could not be solved
“under leadership of the NAACP’s candidate [Bates].” The following
day the <cite>Independent</cite> carried a political advertisement by “friends”
of Timmerman which asked South Carolinians if they wanted as governor
“a man who would owe a political debt to Mojeska Simkins
[then secretary of the state NAACP], the <cite>Lighthouse and Informer</cite>
[a Columbia Negro newspaper now defunct], James M. Hinton or the
NAACP?” The advertisement also wondered whether Bates was
“ashamed to admit NAACP support or afraid to deny it.”<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>By way of degrading Bates further for his alleged connections with
the NAACP, Timmerman, even before the Court decision, declared that
the “NAACP has degenerated into a subversive organization in South
Carolina” and “lives and breathes the ‘big lie.’” (To this James M.
Hinton replied that the charges were and would remain “political demagoguery”
unless Timmerman offered substantiating evidence. He
urged Timmerman to make available to Attorney General Brownell
“any and all information” in his possession which indicated subversion
in the NAACP.)<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>Bates was not above these same tactics. He criticized Timmerman’s
proposal that the state establish three school systems—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
white, one Negro, and one integrated—and dismissed it as a “hastily
devised plan which would include mixed schools in South Carolina.”
Bates favored segregated schools “for the peace, happiness and contentment”
of both the white and Negro races. Offering no specific
proposals to the voters, he advocated establishment of a special committee
of distinguished South Carolinians to consider ways of meeting
the problem. Action should be based on the recommendations of that
committee. Characteristically, Timmerman replied with the allegation
that Bates’ plan was “proposed” by James M. Hinton.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>The campaign was not without its irony. In a statement that
must have been galling to Timmerman, the Columbia <cite>Lighthouse and
Informer</cite>, in reference to Timmerman’s triple school system proposal,
said: “It was more than astounding and gratifying that the younger
Timmerman should show the liberality to come out openly for the
mixing of the races in a segment of the South Carolina schools. We
believe he is the first candidate for high public office to take such a
stand in South Carolina. The <cite>Lighthouse and Informer</cite> congratulates
Mr. Timmerman upon the advancement he has shown in this respect.”
In the same vein the Marion <cite>Star</cite> asked if the triple school proposal
had been made by Timmerman in a bid for NAACP support.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>In 1954-55, while attitudes were hardening on the race issue, there
was increasing criticism of the national political parties and the traditional
role of the South in national politics. Many like the late
Senator Burnet R. Maybank, felt that both national parties had sold
the South down the river. Segregationists frequently blamed the
South itself. For too long, they cried, the solid South had forfeited
its right to political consideration by remaining “in the bag” of the
Democrats.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>In establishing the mood of political rebellion in 1956, segregationist
bitter enders intensified their criticism of the national parties. “Political
forces at the national level,” declared the <cite>News and Courier</cite>,
were “lined up against the Southern way of dealing with the race
question.” This Southern way had enabled the Negro, “a late-comer
in western civilization,” to meet the challenges of the white man’s
culture. The steady progress which the Negro had made in the past
was now in danger of being destroyed by these “misguided agitators”
from outside the South. Only through unity could the white South
meet this threat. Along the same line, the <cite>News and Courier</cite> criticized
the national Democratic Party for seeking Negro votes in key
Northern cities and states. “How long will bribery of minority
blocs” in the name of “welfare” control national politics, it asked.
“Ever since F. D. Roosevelt lured the Negroes away from the Republicans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
with bigger and better promises, the weak rather than the
strong have been shaping the course of the Republic.” The <cite>News and
Courier</cite> observed that “of all the racial and nationality groups” subjected
to such bribery, the Negro was “most easily manageable.” He
had always been “managed” by whites.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Wails of woe came from other quarters. Anyone selecting his
national party on the basis of its position on the racial problem “really
has no place to go today,” declared the <cite>Record</cite>. Yet the paper found
itself in a dilemma. Only lukewarm toward the idea of a third party,
it eventually endorsed Eisenhower in the 1956 campaign.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> More outspoken
was Charleston’s Representative L. Mendel Rivers. He thought
it “tragic” to see President Eisenhower and leaders of both parties
“supinely bowed to the demands of an association which follows the
Communist line of lying, of vilification and untruth aided and abetted
by an iron curtain of a Northern press which is ceaseless and relentless
in its vilification of our people.” This “capitulation” the Charleston
solon thought to be “the most fraudulent and hypocritical surrender
of principle in the history of this republic,” which if carried to its
logical conclusion would “bring a flow of blood unequalled since the
tragic times of the War Between the States.”<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Thomas R. Miller
of Florence expressed another extreme viewpoint when he wondered</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>how any loyal, intelligent Southerner, or any other white American for that
matter, can vote for a man that openly tells the South that the Supreme Court
decision was right, is the law of the land, and should be obeyed, is more than
we can see. Stevenson is the spiritual successor to Roosevelt, who sowed the
seeds of racial hatred and started this country down the road to Communism,
and to Truman, the happy little piano-banger, who cultivated and nurtured both—who
administered the <i lang="fr">coup de grace</i> to Southern white civilization, who consigned
unborn children to racial mongrelization and slavery under the Black
Race, which is what the Communist has in store for the South, and which will
be the lot of our children if our people don’t wake up! If the people don’t
believe it, let them take a little time off from pleasure-seeking, money-making,
starting new organizations and clubs every day, and study it out for themselves.
If this country isn’t going straight down the line of the Communist pattern, then
“there ain’t a dog in Georgia.”<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The political course that extremists would follow in 1956 depended
on the action of the state Democratic Party. They themselves, nominally
Democrats, entertained the hope that they would be strong
enough to control the party as the Dixiecrats had done in 1948. In
South Carolina the state Democratic convention is held much earlier
than in other states. Consequently, it was in early March when the
county conventions met as preliminaries to the state convention. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
many of the county conventions, generally in the lowcountry, extremists
were in control. This was illustrated by the actions of the
Florence County Democratic convention which adopted resolutions
urging restoration of the ⅔ rule in the national party nominations;
reaffirming the delegates’ firm support of states rights; praising the
Citizens Councils and urging Democrats to give them “whole-hearted
support;” commending the <cite>News and Courier</cite> “for its constancy and
unfailing zeal” in fighting racial integration; and rendering the “heartfelt
thanks” of the convention to Editor Thomas R. Waring “for his
courage, his fearlessness and his devotion to duty.”<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Other conventions
adopted similar resolutions.</p>

<p>The state Democratic convention met in Columbia on March 21.
Approximately 525 delegates attended, of whom two—one from Richland
County and another from Beaufort County—were Negroes.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
Governor Timmerman reflected the mood of the delegates in his address
to the convention:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We meet today at a time when our freedom is imperiled—our freedom to choose
our associates and the associates of our children—our freedom to make and enforce
our own local laws in accordance with the wishes of our electorate—our freedom to
establish and maintain our own local institutions without interference or intimidation—these
freedoms and many more are threatened by the deliberate
attempt to destroy constitutional government and to invade rights of the states
and their people....</p>

<p>When we think in terms of racial mixing, remember that it was first advocated
in the United States by the Communist Party. It was then and still is a part
of the Communist program to create dissension and discord. It is a tactic in
the Communist plan to divide and conquer. Racial mixing in the South is a
very real and very meaningful part of the Communist conspiracy.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The Democratic Party of South Carolina, while recognizing a nominal
affiliation with the national Democratic Party, considers itself
autonomous in state political affairs. In contemplating their course
of action in 1956, party leaders weighed the advantages of continued
amicable relations with the national party against the disadvantages
of a potential revolt against their leadership in the state. Elements
loyal to the national party dominated the state convention. They
were strongly anti-integrationist as was evidenced by a resolution
adopted on the second day of the convention. The delegates resolved
that the Fourteenth Amendment in no way applied to education; that
the Supreme Court’s decision was an “illegal and unconstitutional”
verdict based on “sociological and psychological works of comparatively
unknown authors, some of whom were foreigners;” and that the
federal government was guilty of encroachment on the rights of the
states. The strength of party loyalty was shown by the fact that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
convention agreed that “the remedies for the ills which beset us
arising from usurpations, encroachments, unprecedented actions without
legal justification and unreasonable centralization of government”
could best be resolved within the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>While professing complete loyalty to the party, the convention urged
“the States of the South and all others believing in constitutional
government” to counsel together, adopt a program of joint action and
present a united front at the national convention. The Palmetto State
Democrats also urged other states to follow the South Carolina example
of adjourning their state conventions to reconvene after the
national convention.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>In directing the efforts of South Carolina Democrats to achieve an
all-Southern pre-convention unity, the party convention appointed
a steering committee headed by Governor Timmerman. A second
purpose of the committee was to acquaint other Southern states with
the efforts and intentions of the South Carolina Democracy. As committee
chairman, the Governor wrote letters to all Southern senators,
congressmen, governors and Democratic national committeemen. All
of the letters, prefaced with the statement “South Carolina Democrats
want to remain in the National Democratic Party,” said substantially
the same thing: The South could expect an anti-Southern
platform and nominees unless pre-convention unity could be achieved
and a united front presented at the convention.</p>

<p>Response to the appeal was generally disappointing. Southern
senators and congressmen considered it a “sugarcoated” Dixiecrat
movement. However, the Governor was able to secure the calling
of a convention of state party chairmen at Atlanta in July. This
meeting adopted a resolution which urged unity but within the Democratic
Party. Toward this end, another conference was recommended,
this time to be attended by Southern governors, convention delegation
chairmen and vice-chairmen, and members of the convention platform
and resolutions committee.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>This second parley was also held at Atlanta in early August. Four
governors and three United States senators attended along with approximately
thirty other political officials. Again advocates of
“Southern independence” were in a minority and the convention
adopted a declaration which urged unity but again within the Democratic
Party.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> For all their efforts, Southern Democrats achieved
only a minimum of unity.</p>

<p>The <cite>Morning News</cite> and <cite>Independent</cite> were skeptical of these maneuvers,
viewing them as posing the threat of a potential third party
movement. The <cite>Morning News</cite>, furthermore, pointed out the inconsistency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
of Southern Democrats damning the national party for
its attention to minority groups and at the same time demanding
special treatment because of minority standing.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> But the <cite>News and
Courier</cite>, not forgetful of Strom Thurmond’s leadership of the Dixiecrat
movement in 1948, thought South Carolinians should take pride in
Governor Timmerman’s emergence as leader of “Southern Independence”
at a time when other Southern politicians were shielding their
timidity “with the time worn cloak of party loyalty.”<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Others were
no less critical of the emphasis on unity within the party. The <cite>Record</cite>
considered the declaration by the second Atlanta conference “quite
docile,” “timid in tone,” and “disappointing.”<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>At the Democratic National Convention in August the South Carolina
delegation was primarily concerned with securing an acceptable
platform. Governor Timmerman spoke for the delegation before the
platform committee. He warned that a civil rights plank infringing
upon the constitutional rights of the states, a pro-integration plank,
or an approval of the school desegregation decision would insure a
Democratic defeat in November. The basic issue was not “sectionalism,
race <i lang="la">per se</i>, or special privilege,” he maintained. It was whether
“this great Democratic party of individual freedom and states rights
shall survive or ‘rot with radicalism.’”<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>The pleadings of the Southerners were not without success for the
civil rights plank adopted by the Democrats was much milder than
it might have been. In regard to the Supreme Court decision it was
nearer the Southern position than that of the Republicans. No direct
endorsement was given the decision, and force was rejected as a
method of accomplishing compliance. However the Democrats recognized
Supreme Court decisions in general as “part of the law of
the land.” Contrary to Southern wishes, the platform also endorsed
previous Democratic accomplishments in the field of civil rights, e.g.,
armed forces integration, and urged the curbing of the filibuster in
Senate debates.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> In the latter respects the Democratic platform was
further from the Southern position than was that of the Republicans.</p>

<p>Reaction to the platform varied with the more moderate elements
generally considering it a compromise or a Southern victory. However,
the <cite>News and Courier</cite> thought that despite “some weasel words,” the
platform represented “a complete victory for Northern viewpoint and
complete defeat of the South.” To the Charleston paper the platform
added up to “FEPC, mixed schools, Federal investigation of white
Southerners and enthusiastic endorsement of integration in the armed
forces.” The trouble was that people had their terms confused, declared
the <cite>News and Courier</cite>. A “compromise” on the civil rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
issue would have been no civil rights plank at all. A Southern victory
on the issue would have been a platform expressing opposition to the
court decision, invasion of states rights, FEPC and integration in the
armed forces.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The <cite>Record</cite> characterized the platform as “an effort
at straddling, not actually the fence but an area just left of the fence.”<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>Concerning nominees, the South was also not without success in
that Adlai E. Stevenson, the least objectionable of the leading contenders
to the South, won the nomination for President. However,
the Tennessee liberal, Estes Kefauver, loathed by Southern extremists
as a traitor to his section, was selected for Vice-President. The general
strategy of the South Carolina delegation was to vote for Governor
Timmerman as a favorite son in the hope that a candidate less enthusiastic
about the Supreme Court decision than Stevenson would
be nominated.</p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, as was to be expected, blasted the Democratic
ticket. It described Kefauver as “an unprincipled opportunist,
a Southerner who sold out the South for a mess of NAACP votes.”
As for Stevenson, he was “another Franklin Roosevelt.” The rasping
voice of Charleston warned that the United States would be unable
to survive “another scholar-gentleman-socialist in the White House.”
In general agreement, the <cite>Record</cite> thought Stevenson would be “under
virtual compulsion from the NAACP, CIO and other integrationist
groups to act federally against the South.”<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>The upcountry <cite>Independent</cite>, on the other hand, heartily endorsed
the Democratic ticket. Stevenson was characterized as “a man of
decision, wisdom and an understanding of the basic problems confronting
the American people.” The addition of Kefauver gave the
Democrats “an exceptionally strong ticket.”<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> The <cite>Morning News</cite>,
under Editor Rogers, was noncommittal.</p>

<p>The reconvening of the state party convention was the next act in
the political drama. The delegates were about equally split as to
whether to support the national party nominees or to back an independent
movement. When one state party official after another endorsed
party loyalty, the convention, by a narrow vote of 167 to 152½,
officially agreed to stand by Stevenson and Kefauver.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The <cite>News and
Courier</cite> pictured the party crawling back “‘into the bag’ of the socialistic
integrators.” Governor Timmerman, who had urged party
loyalty, received a special share of <cite>News and Courier</cite> wrath. Once
“one of the South’s most lucid supporters of States Rights,” he had
descended to using “unworthy demagoguery” in supporting “his retreat
from the spirit of Southern independence.”<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>Endorsement of the national party platform and nominees by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
state convention set the stage for another political revolt against the
Democratic Party. Such a movement, the origins of which will be
noted subsequently in greater detail, developed immediately following
the state Democratic convention. A considerable division of opinion
existed within the state over the desirability of an independent movement.
In general terms it was one of lowcountry versus upcountry.
Speaking for the latter the <cite>Independent</cite> opposed “the will-o-wisp of a
‘third party,’” which would harm rather than aid Southern efforts to
preserve segregation. It found fallacious the argument of the independents,
namely, that the Southern states, by combining forces, could
throw the election into the House of Representatives. Past political
movements had shown that the South would not unite. Moreover,
even if the election were tossed into the House, either the Democratic
or Republican candidate would be elected; the South would gain nothing.
Questioning the motives of those leading the movement, the
<cite>Independent</cite> suggested that the opposition to the Democrats was based
“less on the segregation issue” than on other considerations. These,
it said pointedly, were economic—special interests arraigned against
the welfare of the working public.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Morning News</cite> was also outspoken in opposing the revolt.
Editor O’Dowd thought it “politic, advantageous and wise” for South
Carolina to preserve its ties with the national Democratic Party. He
chided those South Carolina Democrats who kept themselves “in a
state of permanent rebellion against the National Party.” Such persons
served only the cause of disunity. According to O’Dowd, criticism
of the national party’s liberalism was pointless. The secret of
the party’s strength traditionally was “the presence of liberal forces”
and the balance these struck with the conservatives. He noted that
Thomas Jefferson, who was “almost sacred” to Southern Democrats,
was “further ‘left’ for his day than [Michigan Governor G. Mennen]
‘Soapy’ Williams.” Picturing the Democratic Party as the political
bailiwick of “Harriman-Williams-Kefauver and the ADA” was simply
waving the red flag. The Democratic Party, O’Dowd noted, was also
the party of “Walter George, Sam Rayburn, Lyndon Johnson, Olin
Johnston and the Southland.” Under the new editor, James A. Rogers,
the <cite>Morning News</cite> changed its political line. While not unsympathetic
to the revolt, Rogers took the common sense position that the most
effective protest against the Democratic Party was a vote for the Republican
candidates.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, the state’s leading press advocate of “independence,”
did not understate its editorial theme. The Democratic
Party had become infested with “goons, eggheads, radicals, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
NAACP agitators.” The Republicans were almost as bad. There
was, in reality, no place for “conservative white voters” to go. The
South was not bolting the Democratic Party; rather the party had
long ago bolted the South. The real third party was not that of the
Southern Independents but the Democratic Party gone Socialist. This
situation had created problems, not only in regard to public school
integration, but also “business interference and high cost government.”
The South’s duty was to redeem “the rest of the Republic from Negro
politics” and restore “honor, decency and liberty” to the political
arena of the nation. But the <cite>News and Courier</cite> sadly acknowledged
that the South’s minority status left it in a position of such “helpless
ignominy” that its protest would probably be ineffective. Yet by
voting against both national parties Southerners could at least “preserve
their self respect.”<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>Following refusal of the state Democratic convention to endorse
“independence,” the <cite>News and Courier</cite> printed a lengthy series of “letters
to the editor” commenting on the political situation in South
Carolina. A majority of these advocated Southern independent political
action and held that the state’s delegates should have bolted the
national Democratic convention. Most urged formation of a new
Dixiecrat Party or presentation of a slate of independent electors as
a protest against both national parties. Various names were suggested
as nominees, most prominently Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia
and General Mark Clark. Another suggestion called for the formation
of a third national party which would appeal to “constitutionalists”
and conservatives like Governor J. Bracken Lee of Utah. It would
oppose the “socialism” of the other national parties.</p>

<p>A few of these letters were written by persons prominent in white
supremacy groups, including Micah Jenkins, state Citizens Council
president and chairman for South Carolina of the Federation for Constitutional
Government, and Stanley F. Morse, president of the Grass
Roots League of Charleston.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> But most came from persons of no
particular significance in political circles. A sampling of quotations
taken from these letters reflects the state of mind of the writers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Another John C. Calhoun is the crying need of this hour, for whom we could
all vote in full confidence to represent us in Congress for constitutional government.</p>

<p>We don’t have any leaders in the nation today—we have drivers. Southerners
are being driven like cattle to the slaughter.</p>

<p>If it ever was a time for a Ben Tillman it is now.</p>

<p>I am a Democrat, a follower of Jefferson, Cleveland, Wilson, and Robert
Taft. [!] I have nothing in common with the present National Democratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
Party whose name and organization have been captured by the Radical Socialists
and semi-communists of the Northern city slums, assisted by the crackpots, egg
heads and pseudo-intellectuals of the Northern colleges.</p>

<p>What the AFL-CIO is planning on doing to us is not just “plain” brainwashing.
We are in for a THOROUGH brain-sudsing and scrubbing until every trace of
our Southern ways and traditions is gone and we come out “integration bright.”</p>

<p>The complete subservience of a lot of our politicians to a master such as
party instead of principle is a deplorable state of affairs for this nation.</p>

<p>Our timid and seduced politicians and their cohorts endeavor to shield themselves
by “working within the party.”</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Among the letter writers the Democrats were not without their
racist supporters. One warned: “Vote Republican ... and you won’t
have as many rights as the Negro has ... the word ‘segregation’
will become extinct.... If he [Eisenhower] is reelected you can expect
worse. Should he die, it will be ‘NIX-on’ whites and probably a desegregated
Supreme Court.”<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>Efforts to organize an independent political movement in the state
began even before the decision of the state Democratic party to support
the national party nominees. In early June Micah Jenkins began
distributing petitions seeking the necessary 10,000 signatures to place
an independent slate of electors on the general election ballot. He
charged that the Democratic Party, made up of “radical, minority and
labor groups,” would be unable to protect the interests of the South
without alienating “the Negro, labor and the Americans for Democratic
Action radical elements.”<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> This early effort achieved negligible success.</p>

<p>Following refusal of the state Democratic convention to endorse
a separate slate of independent electors, the dissident extremists held
a meeting in Columbia and organized the “South Carolinians for Independent
Electors.” Their immediate concern was to get 10,000
petition signatures which had to be in the office of the Secretary of
State not later than September 6; the organizational meeting was held
August 27. Chairman of the group was Farley Smith, son of the late
Senator “Cotton Ed” Smith. Prominent among those attending were
Micah Jenkins and S. Emory Rogers, leaders of the Citizens Council
movement. The organizational meeting issued a manifesto which
declared that the Independents were seeking to give voters of the state
“an opportunity to protest” against both national parties.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> More
than three times the number of signatures needed were secured before
the deadline, a not inconsiderable achievement.</p>

<p>The Independent revolt, like that of the Dixiecrats of eight years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
before, stemmed directly out of the segregation conflict. Editor Rogers
of the <cite>Morning News</cite> stated flatly that the Supreme Court’s decision
was “the underlying cause” of the movement. Though there may have
been much truth to the Anderson <cite>Independent’s</cite> statement that the
real reasons for the movement were economic, there was no gainsaying
that the Independents presented themselves as the champions <i lang="fr">ne plus
ultra</i> of white supremacy. Such was admirably illustrated in a pamphlet
which they distributed. A brief summary is informative: A
vote for Stevenson was a vote for integration according to “the warning
uttered by the South Carolina Citizens Councils,” which were “representative
of the states rights thinking of thousands of South Carolinians.”
The civil rights platform of the Democratic Party was a
“complete defeat” for the South, adding up to “FEPC, mixed schools,
Federal investigation of white Southerners and enthusiastic endorsement
of integration in the armed forces.” (A verbatim quotation from
a <cite>News and Courier</cite> editorial of August 16, 1956, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16-A.) The regular
Democratic Party in South Carolina was a “scalawag” party, “to
which most Negroes belong.” The national Democratic Party was
the mouthpiece for “<abbr title="Representative">Rep.</abbr> Adam Clayton Powell of Harlem, Walter
Reuther of the AFL-CIO, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman,
Adlai Stevenson and the turncoat Southerner, Estes Kefauver,” all
enemies of the South.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>On other occasions the Independents were prone to emphasize non-racial
issues and decry “the trend toward government centralized and
socialized, in Washington.”<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Thomas P. Stoney, former mayor of
Charleston who was to become one of the Independent electors, declared
that “the time has come to serve notice on the left-wingers and
crystal-ball gazers of both national parties that we’ve gone just as far
as we’re going” toward “100 percent socialism.”<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Harold Booker, a
Camden newspaper man, told an Independent rally: “In fighting for
the election, you are fighting for your homes, families and Southland.”<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>Originally the Independent electors endorsed no candidate but in
October they decided to back Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia and
Representative John Bell Williams of Mississippi for President and
Vice-President respectively. That Byrd announced he was not a candidate
did not faze the Independents. The <cite>News and Courier</cite> commented
that it “would rather have Harry Byrd president than any
other man in public life.” It described Representative Williams,
whose claim to fame included popularizing the term “Black Monday,”
as a “distinguished Southerner,” the type of man “whom South Carolinians
respect.”<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>The Independents announced their position in several political advertisements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
in newspapers throughout the state. Typical was the
following, which, it might be observed, directly attacked Adlai Stevenson
but did not mention President Eisenhower:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Do you want mixing of the races in schools, factories, shops, offices, restaurants—at
the point of a bayonet if necessary? If so vote for Stevenson and Kefauver.</p>

<p>Do you want to do away with unlimited debate (filibuster) which is the only
protection the South has against laws that big cities of the North will force
upon us? If so, vote for Stevenson and Kefauver who unalterably oppose freedom
of debate.</p>

<p>Do you want the Right-to-work law in South Carolina repealed? If so, vote
for Stevenson and Kefauver who are dedicated to repeal of the Taft-Hartley law.</p>

<p>Do you want a President who would stop tests of H-bombs and enable Russia
to dominate the world? Then Stevenson is your man. He and Bulganin want
to stop these tests in America.</p>

<p>Do you want Socialism to replace the free and independent form of government
under which America has become the greatest nation in the world? Then
vote for either national party. Both are dedicated to Socialism.</p>

<p>Do you want to live under the domination of political machines? Then vote
for and with the politicians who place party label above principle.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The prominence given economic issues is significant. Independent
leaders had two goals: to sound the tocsin for reactionaries and to
show to the country that their movement was premised on grounds
other than racial. Economic policies advocated by Stevenson and the
national Democrats were smeared as “a new America built on Socialistic
and Communistic theories.” In view of the wide use of the term
“socialism,” the <cite>News and Courier’s</cite> definition is interesting. Socialism,
it said, “would give bigger ‘benefits’ to farmers, old people, veterans,
little business men, workers, unemployed persons, the disabled
and children.” This would mean “more handouts for everyone, except
the big corporations—and the government would run them.” Inflation,
controls and higher taxes accompanied such a program. The Independents
also criticized Kefauver’s advocacy of “World Government
under which the United States of America would become a satellite
nation under Communist control.”<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>The Independents never attracted the active support of prominent
Democrats in the state. An important exception was James F. Byrnes.
In an address which the <cite>News and Courier</cite> considered “the speech of a
statesman,” the former governor, senator, war mobilizer, secretary of
state and Supreme Court justice, urged South Carolinians to desert
both national parties and to back the Independents. He criticized
Eisenhower’s support of integration in the District of Columbia and
pictured the Democratic Party, whose nomination for the vice-presidency
he had once coveted, as being “dominated by the bosses of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
big cities, the Americans for Democratic Action, the CIO and the
NAACP.” The <cite>Independent</cite> received Byrnes’ speech less sympathetically.
The up-country paper declared that “the spectacle of this aging
and embittered politician trying to explain unsuccessfully how he
arrived at this dead-end would merit sympathetic pity were it not part
of a calculated effort, based upon hatred for the Democratic Party
that fed and clothed him for over 50 years, to reelect a Republican
president.”<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>During the course of the election campaign, the <cite>Morning News</cite>,
<cite>Record</cite>, <cite>News and Courier</cite> and <cite>Independent</cite> each took a different position
on the question of political revolt. With the exception of the
<cite>Morning News</cite>, which changed editors, the papers continued the positions
which they had taken in the pre-campaign period. The <cite>Morning
News</cite>, under Editor Rogers, was sympathetic to the Independents but
refrained from advising its readers as to how to vote. Rogers’ proposal
for an independent movement to support the Republican candidate
went unheeded. The <cite>Record</cite>, too, was sympathetic to the Independents
but ultimately endorsed the Republicans. It considered a
vote for the Independents as a less effective protest than one for the
G.O.P. The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, which luxuriated in its own world of
perpetual political frustration, gave unqualified endorsement to the
Independents as “a grass roots protest without professional leadership.”
It represented “the people of South Carolina standing up for
their rights, in a spontaneous movement which could overthrow the
forces controlling the State Democratic Party.” Out of it might
“come a force to redeem the Republic and reshape United States
history.”<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>The Anderson <cite>Independent</cite> attacked the movement, its leaders and
its motives. The “agitation” was described as “another effort to give
aid and comfort to the Republican Party and its millions of Negro
adherents.” The Independents included “an unusually high proportion
of rejected office-holders and worn-out political hacks,” “tub-thumpers”
who were using the race issue as a screen for other issues, mainly
economic. When the Independents issued a statement decrying “the
perversion of taxation to a tool of social reform for the redistribution
of wealth,” the Anderson paper concluded that they opposed “such
laws as social security, old age pensions, federal wage and hour laws
to protect workers, federal funds for school lunches, and numerous
other activities designed to benefit the vast majority of citizens who
are not blessed with the status of the independently wealthy.”<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> This
statement was not without irony in view of the <cite>Independent’s</cite> violent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
opposition to labor unions and to the repeal of the state’s right-to-work
law.</p>

<p>The same paper was no less critical of the Republicans. A vote
for either the Republicans or the Independents was “a vote for sending
South Carolina school trustees to jail.” Its editorials contained such
loaded and politically indelicate phrases as “‘Put’em in Jail’ Eisenhower,”
“‘jailing judges,’” “Richard M. (for Mixer) Nixon,” “naming
Negroes to the South Carolina federal bench,” and “a vote for Ike is
a vote for integration.”<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>In the campaign the Democrats made only slightly less use of the
race issue than did the Independents. Democratic strategy was to
present the latter as Republicans in disguise and then to attack the
racial policies of the Republicans. Democrats called Eisenhower “the
greatest integrator since Abraham Lincoln” for his endorsement of
the Court decision; his appointment of Chief Justice Earl Warren;
his elimination of segregation in the armed forces (“Except for this,
it might not be necessary to continue the draft.”); his abolition of
separate recruitments for Navy stewards; his abolition of segregation
in the Charleston Naval Yard; his abolition of segregation in all veterans
hospitals (“The helpless sick are denied any choice.”); and his
abolition of segregation in Washington. Indicative of the Democrats’
attitude was the use of a quotation from an NAACP report stating:
“When freedom, equality, and justice shall have been fully realized
for every citizen, historians of tomorrow may well look back to the
year of 1953 as the beginning of the end of social discrimination and
segregation in the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>The Democrats made wide use of state officials in reassuring voters
that the South’s best hope lay with its traditional party. Congressman
William Jennings Bryan Dorn declared that the support of the
national Democratic Party by Senator Richard B. Russell and Herman
Talmadge of Georgia was sufficient proof for him. The Democrats
also emphasized such issues as Democratic control of Congress and the
appointment of federal judges. State executive committeeman E. P.
Riley of Greenville asked, “Do you want judges selected by our senators,
who believe in our way of life, or do you want them selected by
Negro Congressman Adam Clayton Powell ... [and] Dewey and
Brownell, whose only thought of the South is hatred?”<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans soft-pedalled the race issue and even made some
efforts to attract Negro votes. An undated open letter from State
Republican Chairman Oscar W. Pitts urged all South Carolinians,
“regardless of creed or color,” to support Eisenhower.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Barrington
Parker, a Washington attorney sponsored by the Republican National<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Committee, told the Palmetto State Voters Association that “no thinking
Negro can go to the polls to vote the Democratic ticket.”<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Political
advertisements of the only Republican candidate in the election,
Leon P. Crawford, the mayor of Clemson and the opponent of Senator
Olin D. Johnston, made no reference to the race issue. They noted,
however, Crawford’s belief in “firm aggressive pursuit of States Rights
measures.... Constitutional government of the people, for the people
and by the people ... [and] less Federal meddling in State and local
schools and other affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Henry Gaud, a Charleston County Republican
leader, told Carolinians that segregation was not the issue
in the election. Segregation had been used by the Independents to get
“prejudices aroused.” The real issue was “whether or not this government
is going to become totalitarian. Stevenson believes in socialization.”
He agreed with the Independents that “leftwingers and
racketeers” ruled the Democratic Party.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>Election results showed approximately 138,000 votes for the Democrats,
75,000 for the Republicans and 88,000 for the Independents.
Generally the upcountry counties voted strongly Democratic while
the lowcountry voted Independent. Eisenhower carried two counties,
Aiken and Beaufort in the lowcountry. The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, still
frustrated, expressed disappointment and indignation over the vote
for Stevenson. According to the voice of “independence,” white South
Carolinians again had betrayed themselves to the “compulsory race
mixers, Northern busybodies and professional South-baiters.” They
were disloyal “to their forefathers—such men as Wade Hampton and
John Calhoun.”<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Some consolation was derived from the fact that
for the first time since Reconstruction, the Democratic Party in the
state received less than an absolute majority of the votes cast. Yet
it should also be noted that slightly more than 70 percent of the voters
were against the Independents.</p>

<p>The Negro vote cannot be evaluated accurately but indications are
that it was split fairly evenly between the Democrats and Republicans.
For example Columbia’s Ward Nine, a traditional bellwether
precinct for the Negro vote in the state, gave 551 votes to the Democrats,
504 to the Republicans, 56 to the Independents. Many Negro
dominated precincts throughout the state went Republican, reversing
the 1952 results.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Then the Negroes had voted overwhelmingly
Democratic.</p>

<p>Although most of the drive behind the Independents petered out
with the election returns, leaders of the movement endeavored to keep
the organization alive. In January 1957 a meeting was held in Columbia,
attended by 75 persons. Talk centered on plans for taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
over control of the state Democratic Party organization. Since this
could not be immediately achieved, the 75 had to be content with the
establishment of a permanent organization outside the party. Farley
Smith was reelected chairman of the Independents.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>Because of the large anti-Democratic vote in South Carolina in
1952 and 1956, many consider the state at last ready for a bona fide
two-party system. The more conservative, however, favor continuation
of a one-party system. M. H. Sass, in a revealing newspaper
article, thought that “the very last thing that would be desirable for
South Carolina in the foreseeable future” was the two-party system.
Such, he declared, would “result in the political fragmentation of the
South along social and economic lines.” Southern conservatives would
be aligned with non-Southern conservatives while “Southern workers
and smaller farmers would be in alliance with their national counterparts.”
Such an arrangement would not only be “a severe blow to
the South’s maintenance of its separate identity, culturally speaking,”
but would also give “the balance of political power ... to the Negro.”
Under these circumstances “questions of economic policy, labor relations,
etc., would become paramount issues.” The presence in South
Carolina of “an abundance of raw scalawag material,” said Sass, would
insure chaos if a two-party system were established.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>In the political arena, then, the Supreme Court’s desegregation decision
and the increasing Negro efforts to achieve integration have
resulted in a continuation and intensification of the use by South
Carolina politicians of the race issue. In 1958 indications are that
this situation will not end until the Negro vote becomes important
enough to be vied for by politicians.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER WAR OF YANKEE AGGRESSION</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent10 unindent">Though secession did not survive the Confederate War,
peaceful secession is by no means inconceivable at some
future date.—<cite>News and Courier</cite></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>A featured part of the white South Carolina defense of the racial
<i lang="la">status quo</i> is the allegation that the entire integration drive constitutes
a gigantic conspiracy of jealous Yankees against Dixie. “South-baiting
is currently a fad north of the Mason-Dixon line,” said the
embittered <cite>News and Courier</cite>. Along with other pro-South spokesmen,
the Charleston paper considers the integration crusade a continuation
of the spirit of abolitionism and the “waving of the bloody
shirt.” The South Carolina segregationist state of mind includes
the assumption that a “cold war” exists between the “beleaguered”
South and the rest of the nation. But the struggle of the 1950’8, as
contrasted with that of the 1860’s, is basically one of ideas. Hence
the success of Southern efforts depends upon effective presentation of
the pro-segregation story to the nation. But alas, in this respect,
segregationists face insurmountable handicaps. The South has to
stand alone in the fight to save segregation and such related principles
as “constitutional government, states rights, geographical spread of
governmental powers, unlimited debate in the U. S. Senate, harmonious
relations between the races, (and) separate and excellent school systems.”
Because of the importance of these principles, the <cite>News and
Courier</cite> would have its readers remember that “a little integration”
is like “a little adultery.”<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Southern opposition must be total.</p>

<p>In defending South Carolina against outside criticism, the press of
the state, led by the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, has sought to point out the
absolute superiority of the “Southern way of life.” Referring to the
South in Jeffersonian terms the <cite>Morning News</cite> said: “An agrarian
society helps encourage fundamental decency and proper thinking.
People cannot be closely associated with nature and God’s bounty
without absorbing some appreciation for the proper order of things
and the love of God.”<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> The <cite>News and Courier</cite> decried the fact that
“movies, popular novels, the Northern press, Northern colleges—and
not a few teachers in Southern educational institutions” hammered
at the theme that the South was “hopelessly out-of-date” and “ignorant
and backward.” To combat this point of view, parents of college<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
students were advised to “help their youngsters understand their traditions.
Traditions have to be taught. They aren’t automatically implanted
in the brains of 18 and 19 year-olds.”<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, after “reluctantly” concluding
that “the organized campaign of vilification of the Southern
way-of-life and traditions has been partially inspired by malice,”
declared, not inaccurately, that the Southern resistance was the result
of “a unique and imperishable nationalism in the South.” This
nationalism was not aggressive, it asserted. “It was cradled in the
intense desire to be left alone.” It was rooted in the pride that
Southerners had in their unique way of life.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>The South as the defender of traditional American values was the
theme of a speech by Representative William Jennings Bryan Dorn.
Employing terminology reminiscent of his famous namesake, he referred
to his region as “the last frontier of Americanism.” It was the
duty and challenge of the South to sell its “political, industrial and
educational philosophy” to the rest of the country. “I’m proud I
represent people who live in the Bible Belt,” said Dorn. “I had much
rather represent the Bible Belt than some of the slums and confusion
that exist in many of our larger cities.”<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>Just as the South’s efforts to preserve segregation are warmly applauded,
so are the North’s essays at integration roundly condemned.
Here, again, the <cite>News and Courier</cite> is the leading though by no means
the only spokesman. Comparing the segregated South with the integrated
North, it stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Segregation in the South at least has prevented terrorism in cities. Crime
exists, of course, but nothing like these reports from Northern cities. Undisciplined
packs roam their streets. In the South we have no packs of savages.
Though Negroes are more numerous, they are better behaved. Yes, and more
CIVILIZED! They stay to themselves. They recognize and accept the limits
set up for themselves and for white people.</p>

<p>Released from social restrictions of the segregation code, Negroes are running
wild in the North. That is what the North would inflict on a far greater scale
on the people of the South.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>On another occasion, the same paper indicated that its ideas on
racial superiority extended not only to Negroes but to many whites
as well: “Are these so-called Northern spokesmen actually Northern
Americans? Are they from good old New England Yankee stock?
Are they solid inland families, descended from pioneers who crossed
the plains? Or are they first-generation mal-contents, full of alien
notions? Are they recent immigrants from who knows where—Russia,
perhaps?” Then in a not too subtle type of innuendo the <cite>News<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
and Courier</cite> wondered “what kind of schism are they trying to drive
through the Federal Union of States? Why, other than for Communist
reasons, would they wish to split that union?”<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Many white South Carolinians accuse the North of hypocrisy.
Governor Timmerman, for example, declared that “Northern propagandists
are as loud, obnoxious and untruthful today as the Abolitionists
were a century ago.” Integrationists, like the abolitionists,
he asserted, are hypocrites. Editor Waring of the <cite>News and Courier</cite>
stated that while the South had always been “open and above-board”
in its treatment of Negroes, the North had been “sly and underhanded.”<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
Since the North had preserved segregation practically intact
despite absence of legal sanction and non-discrimination laws, several
spokesmen, including James F. Byrnes, urged the Gressette School
Segregation Committee to go above the Mason-Dixon line to study
Northern methods.</p>

<p>White South Carolinians are especially critical of Northern news
media—newspapers, periodicals, radio and television. Blithely ignoring
the pressure for conformity within the South, the <cite>News and Courier</cite>
criticized Northern leaders who allegedly parroted words which they
thought the public wanted to hear. The courage to tell the truth
outside the South, complained the lowcountry newspaper, was at one
of its lowest points in history.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>Alleged reluctance of national news media to present sympathetically
the pro-segregation cause has given rise to such terms as the
“Paper Curtain” and the “Integration Curtain” and the charge that
the South is being “brainwashed” into acceptance of the alien notion
of integration. In no other aspect of the desegregation controversy
is the cornered and minority status of the South more apparent. With
ever increasing frequency, complaints have arisen against pro-integration
statements and incidents appearing on national television
and radio networks, in national periodicals and in the Northern metropolitan
press. Newspapers such as the <cite>New York Times</cite>, the <cite>New
York Herald Tribune</cite>, and the <cite>Washington Post and Times-Herald</cite>
are subjected to constant attack. Mass circulation periodicals such as
<cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite>, <cite>Look</cite>, <cite>Time</cite> and <cite>Life</cite> likewise receive special
criticism. Among nationally circulated periodicals only the <cite>U. S. News
and World Report</cite>, whose editor David Lawrence appeals to the most
reactionary elements in the South, has won South Carolina approval.
The Columbia <cite>State</cite>, for example, had the following to say of <cite>Time</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Through stupidity or malice <cite>Time</cite> has repeatedly followed, with the rest of
the blackguard Northern press, this tone of false witness, either directly or by
innuendo, against the South. <cite>Time</cite> has consistently paraded the idea that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
too stupid or malicious to recognize the fact that the South is a part of the United
States. Refusing to accept the sword of Robert Lee tendered at Appomattox,
it continues by snide inference, malicious innuendo and biased implication to
fight the Confederate War against this section, blind to the fact that <cite>Time</cite> and
the rest of the inflammatory press is following the same line of wild-eyed chatter
that led to Secession in 1860—with grim determination arraying section against
section, gracelessly exaggerating the faults of one, while cravenly covering up
those of the other.</p>

<p><cite>Time</cite> has double-crossed the American people on so many important issues,
through stupidity or malice, that a better name for the weekly would be “Two-Time.”<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Instances of racial violence and incidents of discrimination against
Negroes in the North and West quite naturally, and rightly, afford
grist for the mill to editorial writers on South Carolina newspapers.
Statements such as “clean up the mess in your own back yard before
criticizing us” and “in the South there is frankness; in the North
hypocrisy” are interspersed with “you don’t see any race riots in the
South” or “the Northern states are finding that Southerners are not
the only ones concerned with maintaining racial barriers.” The
racial disturbances at Calumet Park in Chicago and the bigotry displayed
by some of the residents of Levittown, Pennsylvania in the
summer of 1957 were eagerly seized upon by counter-attacking South
Carolina editors. That the great majority of people in the North deplored
such incidents—as was true of most Southerners in the Little
Rock affair—was carefully masked by editorial legerdemain and the
views of the rabidly intolerant minority presented as typical. News
of racial tension outside the South and in it—insofar as opposition
to any and all forms of integration was concerned—is featured by
blazing front page headlines that can only further incite South Carolina
extremists. Some South Carolina editors, like Thomas Waring
of the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, deplore the fact that similar editorial tactics
are not utilized in the Northern press. In a particularly biting editorial
Waring declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is too bad no seismograph records the range of press hypocrisy in the North.
The handling of the Chicago race riots would have registered severe shocks in
some big cities.</p>

<p>Editions of the <cite>New York Herald-Tribune</cite> for Monday and Tuesday ... contained
not a line about a serious racial clash in the country’s second largest city.</p>

<p>The <cite>New York Times</cite> on Monday printed an Associated Press dispatch seven
inches long on page 10. The <cite>Times</cite>, with unrivaled facilities of its own for gathering
news all over the world, did not see fit to print the full AP account. Tuesday’s
issue ... contained no story on all further disorders occurring in Chicago on
Monday.</p>

<p>The handling of the local story by the <cite>Chicago Daily News</cite> is also interesting.
It was printed on page 3 under a headline saying “Man Fined $50 in Race Flareup.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
The <cite>Daily News</cite> devoted its entire back page to pictures of the earthquake damage
in Mexico City. No pictures showed the race riots in the city where the <cite>Daily
News</cite> is published. The riots were called “racial disturbances” throughout.</p>

<p>Does any reader wonder how these newspapers would have displayed “racial
disturbances” had they occurred in South Carolina, Mississippi, or elsewhere this
side of the Paper Curtain? Race riots aren’t news in the North.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Of all the Northern newspapers, the <cite>New York Times</cite> is the chief
<i lang="fr">bête noire</i> of the South Carolina press in general and the <cite>News and
Courier</cite> in particular. The Charleston paper’s plaint is that the <cite>Times</cite>
is a “liberal” paper which writes its own views into news stories. As
to the <cite>Times’</cite> liberalism the <cite>News and Courier</cite> summed it up by saying
that the New York paper “places its faith in government and laws
for rapid improvement of mankind. It is a concept much like the
totalitarian ideology.” The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, which professes admiration
for Cuba’s Batista and the Dominican Republic’s Trujillo,
proceeded to develop this idea further: “The history of the world
does not indicate that laws improve the breed. The best that can be
hoped from laws, as we see it, is to maintain law and order so that
people can live out their lives in some degree of safety and comfort.
By tampering with the laws and customs about race in the United
States, the ‘liberals’ have created disorder and discomfort both in the
South and in the North.... Today, as it has been doing for years,
the <cite>Times</cite> is pamphleteering for its cause—the intermingling of the
races.”<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>The summer of 1957 was a particularly fecund one for attacks on
conditions in the North by South Carolina newspapers. Revelations
in the Syracuse, New York press of filthy and abominable conditions
in migrant labor camps in the Empire State coupled with NAACP
charges of peonage and the ordering by Governor Averill Harriman
of a sweeping investigation by state authorities occasioned the <cite>State</cite>
to send staff writer Bob Pierce northward on a “muckraking” expedition.
Pierce, who received full co-operation from the Syracuse <cite>Post-Standard</cite>
which threw open its files to him, sent back to Columbia
a series of stories that were picked up by other papers of the state.
They were like heady wine for the embattled defenders of the Southern
way of life. Enjoying for the moment the luxury of having still another
tangible social abuse in the North to attack, the <cite>State</cite> combined in
several editorials a mixture of Southern chauvinism, eloquence, and
what it evidently considered to be irony. Said editor Latimer on one
occasion: “Now we read a complaint that New York migrant camps
are a twentieth century slave racket. Well, the people up North
should know how to operate such a place. Their forbears were primarily
responsible for the introduction of slavery in this country....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Conditions up North must be getting bad for the NAACP to admit
that anything but racial harmony and fair treatment to Negroes is
to be found above Mr. Mason and Mr. Dixon’s line.”<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>That the national news media have been at least partially effective
in shaping public opinion in the segregation controversy is evidenced
by the repeated criticisms of their policies. The <cite>News and Courier</cite>
declared that freedom of the press as it related to “truth about race
matters” had already vanished “from a large segment of American
daily newspapers.” Race news was rarely reported outside the South
without a pro-NAACP bias. Also radio and television and Hollywood
film producers were “under the black curtain of race censorship.”
“The other day, in a Charleston theater, we saw a movie short in which
John C. Calhoun was pictured as a scheming, treasonous troublemaker,”
the <cite>News and Courier</cite> indignantly exclaimed. In a letter to the
same paper Fred Grossman noted “a palpable spirit of antipathy” between
the North and South, a feeling which he blamed on the NAACP
“and affiliated organizations of equally dubious allegiance.” Southerners
on national television shows, he asserted, were “inevitably browbeaten,
ridiculed, outwitted by well-rehearsed MC’s.” In the movies,
Southerners were always villains. As a result of this slyly conducted
campaign of propaganda and insinuation, the mere mention of the
word South automatically brought to mind such “evil connotations
as bigot, demagogue, Simon Legree and the like.”<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, insisting that it does “not especially admire
a policy of pandering to popular views to please the subscribers,” and
summarizing its presentation of the race controversy as “the truth as
we see it,” proclaims itself as far more objective than its Northern
counterparts. In presenting “the truth as we see it,” the <cite>News and
Courier</cite> commented in the following fashion on the segregation riots
of Clinton, Tennessee:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Truly, this is a tragic time in American history.... Who would have thought
that tyranny would come so quickly to America, or that the federal government
would seek to restore all the brutality and oppression of Reconstruction days?
And yet the day of infamy has arrived....</p>

<p>Today the North approves the methods of Hitler in attempting to force racial
mixing upon a people who will not mix. If Nazi techniques are upheld by the
higher courts and by public opinion in the North, one day the people of the
North themselves will feel the sting of tyranny.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The newspaper chose to overlook the fact that “the brutality and
oppression” in Tennessee was being enforced by the National Guard
of the state, called out by the governor and not the federal government.
Ignored too was the parallel of “racial superiority” both in
Nazi Germany and in Tennessee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
That some white South Carolinians accept the Charleston paper
at face value as the fountainhead of truth is indicated by a letter to
the editor by C. H. Ruppert of Charleston. Ruppert wrote: “Each
time I pick up an issue of your paper, I thank God I live in a state
where the truth is printed regardless of personal views and I also
know that both sides are presented in any issue that may arise. If
the truth could be presented in the Northern papers, maybe the honest
and worth while people who live there could understand Southern
people for what they really are.”<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>Frequently blame for the whole integration fight is placed on “Negro
politics.” “Afro-Americans,” said the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, “brought
in chains to the New World, are about to seek their revenge. They
are forging now the handcuffs whereby 10 percent of the population
would dominate 90 percent through the fluke of concentration.” This
observation concluded: “More than ever the Southern States seem
destined to play a role in eventual redemption of the rest of the Republic
from Negro politics.”<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>South Carolina newspapers throughout the entire segregation-integration
controversy of the past four years have shown a peculiar
insensitivity in regard to the effort of the United States to win the
support of the nations of Asia and Africa. They have refused to see
any connection with the propaganda efforts of the nation’s diplomacy
in behalf of the democratic ideology and their espousal of racial
supremacy doctrines at home. A naked statement demonstrating
lack of concern with this particular problem came not surprisingly
from the <cite>News and Courier</cite> which entertains no special regard for the
democratic credo: “We are tired of manufactured nonsense about
‘propaganda’ overseas. The suggestion that American laws and customs
are subject to foreign veto makes us sick. Our government
should not look over its shoulder to see whether it wins applause or boos
from the peanut galleries of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Such an internationally myopic viewpoint could be expected from
the embattled <cite>News and Courier</cite> but one could hardly anticipate it
being broadcast in a more sophisticated form by Donald S. Russell
who when he expressed it was president of the University of South
Carolina, a position which he resigned a few weeks later. Addressing
the Bamberg Lions Club, Russell lashed out against “the ill-advised
efforts of many heedless busybodies to inject the issue of school integration
in the South into American foreign policy.”<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Conceivably
Russell was speaking strictly for home consumption as he was in the
process of preparing the ground for his announcement as a gubernatorial
candidate. Yet this outlook was hardly befitting a man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
fancies himself to be well informed in the realm of international diplomacy
and who has served as Assistant Secretary of State.</p>

<p>In recognition of the influence of mass communication, various
proposals have been advanced to overcome the absence in the South
of a single pro-segregation newspaper or periodical of nationwide
standing. The South, lamented the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, had lost its
voice in an age of miraculous means of communication. Consequently
the Southern arguments were not heard in the North. The “primary
need” of the South, then, was “a non-profit and non-political organization
to present the Southern viewpoint.” Financed by voluntary
contributions by Southerners, such an organization would employ lawyers
to argue segregation cases before the courts, issue press releases
on the position of segregationists, and furnish speakers to present the
Southern argument to the nation.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Ironically, it is largely on these
very grounds that South Carolinians have condemned the NAACP!</p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> has taken other steps to bolster the Southern
ramparts against the integrationists. It plugs W. E. Debnam’s “handbooks
for Southerners,” <cite>Then My Old Kentucky Home Good Night</cite>
and <cite>Weep No More My Lady</cite>. These would intellectually fortify
those Southerners who were “being brain-washed by experts” from
the North. Southerners who bought the books, furthermore, could send
them to Northern acquaintances. On another occasion the <cite>News and
Courier</cite> presented itself as covering the race controversy “more than
any other newspaper in the country.” In one of its own advertisements
it suggested three ways to pierce the “Paper Curtain”: (1)
Southerners could correspond with relatives, friends and business acquaintances
in the North and “tell the truth as they know it;” (2)
better yet they could “send pamphlets, clippings and other printed
arguments through the mail;” (3) “most effective of all would be
to send <cite>The News and Courier</cite>.” A gift subscription was at their command.
In 1956 the paper issued a twenty-five cent pamphlet, entitled
“We Take Our Stand,” containing thirty-two of its editorials
on the race issue. Such methods as these caused the <cite>Independent</cite> to
comment sourly: “The Charleston <cite>News and Courier</cite> ... constantly
stirs the [race] issue with one hand while reaching out with the other
to cash in on the agitation by advertising itself as a ‘Southern spokesman’
without peer, urging ‘buy me, buy me.’ The theory seems to be:
more strife, more profit.”<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>W. D. Workman Jr. suggested establishment of a “Southern Foundation”
to foster “recognition of Southern achievements (and attitudes)
in the fields of industry, agriculture, politics and government, education
and sociology.” The foundation could “aid in breaking down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
the obvious and discriminatory refusal of Northern publishers to print
anything out of the South which does not conform with their preconceived
ideas of ‘liberality in the New South.’” Finally it “could
offset some of the mealy-mouthed preachments of ‘dogooder’ organizations
within and without the South which seek to develop a guilt complex
among Southerners for simply being Southerners.”<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The “Bookworm,” writing in the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, suggested a
boycott against publications attacking segregation. He proposed that
(1) all Southern organizations “secede from their national affiliations,”
thereby taking large numbers of members and dues from national
groups which were attempting to “influence Southern thought
and action”; (2) Southerners discontinue subscriptions to national
publications unfriendly to the South; and (3) Southerners notify
advertisers in these publications that their products are no longer
being used.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>Scion of an old Charleston family, Arthur Ravenel, Jr., a member
of the state House of Representatives, proposed to the Columbia Rotary
Club the creation of a fund to be used for the purpose of buying
up Northern newspapers and magazines and other media of information.
The fund would be financed by non-interest paying bonds subscribed
to by loyal South Carolinians. Through these captive magazines
“the Southern and conservative story” could be told to America.
“You cannot win a defensive battle or a defensive war,” said Ravenel.
“South Carolina, as we know her and love her, cannot survive another
decade unless we take the offensive quickly and maintain it
vigorously. We alone among the forty-eight states can do it. We
have the wherewithal. Our assets include a singleness of purpose
among our people; geographical unity; an illustrious history; a social
system free of racial strife; two societies complete and separate, living
in mutual respect for one another; and a community of real Americans.”
South Carolina, continued this young legislator, had “no ‘pinks,’ no
reds, no ‘isms.’ We have the type of people who form the backbone of
the nation. We have a story that can be told.” The battle to win men’s
minds could be won, Ravenel maintained. “That real American,
David Lawrence, had proven with the <cite>U. S. News and World Report</cite>
that America avidly seeks the truth.”<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>Suggestions of this nature also reached into the state legislature.
In the 1957 session, Representative F. Mitchell Ott of Orangeburg
County introduced a resolution calling for the creation of a nine-member
commission which would interest other Southern states in
sending delegations to visit Northern and Western state legislatures.
The purpose of such visits would be to arouse these states to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
threat of “continuing and accelerating invasion of states rights by the
federal government.”<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>The successfully waged battle for passage of a federal civil rights
act revealed the extent of the South’s isolation from the rest of the
country. It was looked upon in South Carolina and the other deep
South states as but another campaign in the insidious war of Yankee
aggression. The first skirmishes occurred in the spring of 1956 when
the Eisenhower administration asked Congress to enact a civil rights
law which would include creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate
individual grievances and creation of a new civil rights
division in the Department of Justice. The proposals also provided
that any citizen who felt that his constitutional rights had been infringed
might go directly to a federal court with his complaint, bypassing
the state courts.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>Reaction to these proposals ranged from indignation to outright
defiance. Senator Olin D. Johnston considered them “a brazen attempt
to abolish all states rights and to establish a form of dictatorship
government.” Never before had the nation come “as close to
creating a Hitler or Stalin type dictatorship.” The <cite>Independent</cite> compared
them to the “‘force bills’ Black Republicans put into effect”
during Reconstruction. Their purpose was to “create more strife”
and to “capitalize on such strife to create more Negro votes for the
Republican Party.” The <cite>News and Courier</cite> also considered the proposals
“force bills aimed at the South.” The purpose was “political
reconstruction, in an all-out attempt to capture the Negro vote.”
They meant “invasion of liberties guaranteed under the Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>The 1956 Civil Rights Bill died in the Senate; consequently, in
1957 a new and stronger bill was introduced into Congress. Again
state leaders bellowed their opposition. Representative L. Mendel
Rivers charged that the 1957 proposals were based on “a contemptible,
malicious, dastardly lie” about conditions in the South. Such a law
“is not only not needed but violates every guarantee the Constitution
gives us.” Passage of the bill would drench the nation with more
“blood than ever a mutinied ship.” All Americans, not only Southerners,
would lose their rights with passage of the bill. Senator Thurmond
warned the House Judiciary Committee that adoption of the
“so-called civil rights” proposals would “turn neighbor against neighbor,”
deprive citizens of their rights to trial by jury and “keep our
people in a constant state of apprehension and harassment.”<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>An organized campaign of resistance developed in the state to the
1957 civil rights proposals. Appearing for South Carolina before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
Judiciary Committee of the national House of Representatives were
Senator Thurmond; Representative Dorn; state Representative Robert
E. McNair of Allendale, chairman of the South Carolina House Judiciary
Committee; Thomas A. Pope of Newberry, former state House
Speaker, currently chairman of the South Carolina Bar Association
Executive Committee; state Representative James A. Spruill from
Cheraw, member of the House Education Committee; and Columbia
attorney Clint T. Graydon. Each in turn made impassioned pleas
that the bill not be passed and that the South be left alone to deal with
the race problem as it saw fit. Their arguments were generally based
on legalistic and constitutional grounds.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> They gave increased significance
to a statement by <cite>Morning News</cite> editor O’Dowd that in the
South democracy and states rights had come to mean that all men were
equal but some less equal than others.</p>

<p>Commenting on the testimony of the state’s representatives the <cite>News
and Courier</cite> said that South Carolina could “be proud” of its legislators
and private citizens who spoke before the committee. “Clarity, honesty,
dignity and understanding” characterized their addresses. “South-haters
picture Southerners as Stone Age men, roughnecks and demagogues.
They must have been bitterly disappointed when our spokesmen,
in cool, intelligent tones, warned of perils threatening freedom
in all 48 states.”<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>South Carolina’s delegation in Congress opposed the civil rights bill
<i lang="la">in toto</i> but they were unhappily aware they could not prevent passage
of an act in 1957. Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson, it is
rumored, had told Southern Senators in January that a bill was going
to be enacted and that they had better forget about their usual “corn
and pot liquor” arguments and consider the legislation on its own
merits.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Under such circumstances the strategy of Southerners in
Congress was to take a last ditch stand against the most vulnerable
of the bill’s provisions, namely that violators of Federal court orders
be subject to punishment by a judge of the court without benefit of
jury trial. By insisting on a jury trial amendment to the bill, the
Southerners could present themselves as the real defenders of civil
rights.</p>

<p>Yet the spectacle of the Southerners in Congress presenting themselves
as champions of jury trials was ironic in light of the fact that
jury trials were not guaranteed those similarly accused in state courts.
South Carolina law, for example, provided that disobedience of a
court order “may be punished by a judge as for a contempt.” Also,
circuit courts might punish “by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
of the court, all contempts of authority in any cause or hearing before
the same.”<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>Both in the House of Representatives and the Senate South Carolina’s
delegation fought a last ditch battle for total rejection of the civil
rights bill. Speaking for his fellow House members from South Carolina,
Representative Dorn argued that the bill was not needed and
that it would further centralize power in Washington and pave the
way for a “federal dictatorship.” Nor would South Carolina representatives
accept any part of the jury trial compromise, said Dorn.
An identical opinion came from Senator Thurmond who believed it
“entirely wrong to make any concession on the jury trial amendment
or any part of the bill.” The Constitution, he said, “specifically provides
for jury trials in all criminal cases and the Constitution cannot
be compromised.” Senator Johnston was equally adamant. He complained
of not having been consulted on the compromise measure and
accused the leadership in both the House and the Senate of high-handed
and illegal procedures. In the closing debate on the bill Johnston declared:
“The cornerstone of human liberty is being shattered....
This is the most backward looking, retrogressive compromise that has
ever issued from any self-appointed committee within my knowledge,
memory, or understanding.”<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Both South Carolina representatives and other Southern members
of the Congress were engaged in a fruitless struggle. The civil rights
bill, largely rewritten by Democratic senators and their advisers, was
accepted by the House of Representatives which previously had approved
a more stringent Administration measure. With this hurdle
surmounted, only Senate approval remained. Since Reconstruction
days, however, the Senate had been the graveyard for civil rights bills.</p>

<p>South Carolina political leaders continued to hope that the Senate
would perform its traditional role and that Southern senators in general
and their own in particular would resort to the filibuster, the ultimate
weapon of beleaguered minorities. They clung to this hope in
face of the fact that the Democratic leadership in the Senate had exacted
an agreement from a caucus of Southern senators against use
of such a tactic. Yet South Carolinians knew that a filibuster at best
would merely delay passage of the bill and at worst invoke a move for
cloture and result in the adoption of a more drastic act.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>True to form, Governor Timmerman called on “American citizens
... to demand that their representatives stand up and fight for
what is right or step aside and let there be elected men with political
courage who will.” The bill, he charged, was a “sell-out of principle
for the evil of political expediency.” Should Southern senators “at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
this late hour falter or fail to filibuster,” they would be held accountable
for “compromising the inalienable rights of the American people.”
Similarly, Representative Mendel Rivers of Charleston stated that “if
I were a senator, I’d talk until hell freezes over before I’d accept this
bill.... I’d filibuster whether Lyndon B. Johnson is elected President
or not.” Representative Robert Hemphill hoped that the Senate
would “filibuster til Christmas if necessary.” Other South Carolina
representatives expressed like sentiments.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>Senator Johnston did not heed the pleas of those urging resort to
the filibuster; he had left Washington temporarily to attend the marriage
of his daughter in Columbia. But the state’s junior senator
responded nobly. Obtaining the floor of the Senate at 8:45 <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>m. on
August 28th, J. Strom Thurmond began a record-breaking filibuster
that finally terminated twenty-four hours and eighteen minutes later.
It was a prodigious effort and brought congratulations from Senator
Wayne Morse of Oregon, the previous record holder.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> But it only
delayed passage of the compromise civil rights bill; more important,
it brought an avalanche of adverse criticism on Thurmond’s balding
head, particularly from infuriated fellow Southern senators who charged
him not only with violating the caucus agreement, but also of making
a grandstand play for personal political advantage.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>Back home, reaction to Thurmond’s filibuster was on the whole
favorable though hardly enthusiastic. Many persons privately acknowledged
that he had made a complete fool of himself. Particularly
was this true in Columbia where local leaders were making a strenuous
effort to retain Fort Jackson. It was feared that Thurmond’s action
might ultimately hurt the city’s cause. Governor Timmerman, fighting
mad, was the Senator’s principal defender. He was “shocked” to
learn that Thurmond had received no help in his heroic battle. “When
the going got rough,” he growled to a press conference, the Southern
senators had “fallen down on the job.” He resented for Thurmond
“the effort to belittle what he did.” The Senator, he said, “hasn’t
broken faith with anyone; he’s the only one who didn’t break faith....
I’m commending, not condemning, what Strom Thurmond did.” Timmerman
was sure that the people of the Palmetto State “didn’t send
Senator Thurmond to Washington to be a political flunky for Johnson,
Knowland or Eisenhower.” In what could be interpreted only as a
rebuke to Senator Johnston, the irate Governor asserted that when the
next election time came, he “would take a second look at the man who
turned his back on his constituents” before he would support him.
Finally, lashing out in another direction, Timmerman called President
Eisenhower “a disgrace to the office he holds.”<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
Timmerman’s remarks were resounded in <cite>News and Courier</cite> editorials
which observed that while Thurmond had made himself unpopular
with many Americans and his fellow Senators, he spoke for the overwhelming
majority of South Carolinians. “An occasional sneer that
Senator Thurmond was putting on a personal play to the grandstands
merits no attention,” said the Charleston paper. “When personal conviction
tallies with the demands of the people, why shouldn’t a senator
stand up and say so even though he stands alone?” The <cite>News and
Courier</cite>, like the <cite>Morning News</cite>, hesitated to say that the other Southern
senators had compromised with principle, as had Governor Timmerman.
But it did not believe that “others should blame Thurmond
for acting alone.” The <cite>State’s</cite> editor, Samuel Latimer, seemingly
caught with his editorial directive down, could muster only a brief
nine line comment on Thurmond’s filibuster, the gist of which was
that it was a futile but creditable performance.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>From Anderson, however, came a bitter blast against Thurmond
from the <cite>Independent</cite>: “The very junior senator from South Carolina,
Mr. ‘Stand-On-Head’ Thurmond was all steamed up this week in opposition
to the Ike, Nixon, Brownell civil rights bill. All his ‘oratory’
in the Senate will not erase the fact that Thurmond helped put the
present anti-South Republican Party in power. He can change his
colors—and his speeches—but the folks back home will always remember
that he is one of the forces that have plunged a dagger into
the heart of the South. South Carolina voters will be waiting—and
ready—when ‘Stand-On-Head’ comes up for reelection. Any good
Democrat can trim him and he knows it. That’s why all the smoke
at the moment. Something is urgently needed by the little man to
divert attention from his support of the Republicans....”<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Passage of the civil rights bill did not mean its acceptance in any
way, manner or means by South Carolina leaders. Governor Timmerman
immediately let it be known that he would not co-operate with
any civil rights investigation commission that might come to South
Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>The worst crisis in the current “war of Yankee aggression” on the
South came, of course, in the early autumn of 1957 with the Little
Rock affair. South Carolina resounded with praise for Governor
Orval Faubus and condemnation of President Eisenhower. As in all
of the deep South states, white South Carolinians were aghast at the
President’s use of troops to enforce the integration decree of the “northern
judge,” Justice Ronald N. Davies. The state’s press, its politicians,
and its self-appointed spokesmen joined in a crescendo of
verbal abuse on President Eisenhower, Attorney-General Herbert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Brownell, Mayor Woodrow Wilson Mann of Little Rock, Vice-President
Richard Nixon, Presidential aide Sherman Adams, and Adlai
Stevenson—the last named for supporting the President.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> Governor
Timmerman made the state’s outstanding gesture of protest by resigning
his commission as an officer in the United States Naval Reserve,
a gesture which apparently did not disturb the Navy in the least.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
Someone scrawled “Ike is a nigger-lover” on the door of the children’s
entrance to the Richland County library in Columbia. In university
classrooms, students who only a year before had “liked Ike” were
asking professors how they “could get rid of him.” If Little Rock
had been in South Carolina, white South Carolinians could hardly
have been more concerned.</p>

<p>In placing the hero’s laurels upon the brow of Governor Faubus,
his admirers rarely if ever were willing to face up to the fact that the
Arkansas chief executive, by calling out the state’s national guard to
prevent Negro children from enrolling at Central High School, was
preventing the execution of the law of the United States. Nor was it
acknowledged that his utterly reckless statements had anything to do
with creating the atmosphere of tension that nourished the violence
which engulfed Central High School on the first day of the new term.
South Carolina post-mortem editorial comment criticized resort to
violence but, with a curious twist of logic, those guilty of violence were
less condemned than those who allegedly had created it. The thugs
who kicked and beat Negroes and newsmen and the sideburned adolescents
whose faces reflected their hatred as they jeered or struck at
the Negro students were never really denounced outright. Instead
the villains of the piece were declared to be the leaders of the NAACP
and the “Northern agitators” who were accused of inciting the violence.
South Carolina editorialists in deploring use of violence, as they invariably
did, always left an escape door for those who resorted to it.
Illustrative are the following editorial comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite> deplores terror tactics in any cause. Yet men have used
them to promote all kinds of efforts both worthy and unworthy—including religion.
People of good will do not want violence and bloodshed over integrating the
schools of the South. Yet many of those people would rather be dead than
integrated. Shall white people be exterminated to make room for colored? They
outnumber the colored and they will not give up easily. (<abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 19, 1957, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 8-A.)</p>

<p>Efforts to enforce the court’s integration edict already are resulting in violent
acts by hoodlums, bedsheet gangsterism and vandalism. This is deplored by the
vast majority of Southerners as injurious to the cause of the South.... Yet
it does not seem to have gotten through the thick heads in Washington and elsewhere
in the North and West that Southerners will not quail in the face of bloodshed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
if bayonets are directed against them by hogwild racist South-baiters.
(Anderson <cite>Independent</cite>, <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 21, 1957, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 4).</p>

<p>Decent citizens everywhere abhor violence; [the] South is not lawless....
The South has a right to try to maintain its way of life by any and all lawful
means. It has done so for a hundred years despite the outcome of the war that
prevented them [sic] from seceding from the Union, when that seemed to many
of them the only way to uphold it. (Florence <cite>Morning News</cite>, <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 19, 1957, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 4).</p>

<p><cite>The State</cite> cannot condone violence. It never has, and never will. Neither
can it condone the actions of agitators and others who bring about violence....
There was no disorder until the judge caused the Arkansas Guard to be removed.
The disorder came after the judge and Mayor Mann of Little Rock took charge....
We want to keep the record straight as to under whose auspices the rioting
occurred. (<abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 26, 1957, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 4-A).</p>

<p>No thinking citizen of the South will condone the violence that erupted in
Little Rock when federal, city, and school authorities and the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People disregarded Governor Faubus’ advice
to allow for a cooling-off period before attempting the integration of nine Negroes
into Little Rock’s Central High School. Mob violence is not the answer to anything
anywhere, except as an instrument of revolution. It solves nothing. (<cite>Record</cite>,
<abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 25, 1957, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 4-A).</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>In none of the above editorial excerpts was a word of sympathy
extended to the victims of violence or an express denunciation made
against those engaged in the particular acts. One is reminded of the
old condemnations of lynching. No one “approved” the practice in
principle, but.... On the other hand, when an Arkansas segregationist,
C. E. Blake, was struck on the head with the butt of a rifle which he
was trying to wrest away from a federal soldier standing guard, there
was more admiration for than censure of his action. Senator Johnston
suggested to Governor Faubus that “warrants be issued for the arrest
of federal soldiers responsible for unnecessary bludgeoning of Arkansas
citizens and unlawful invasion of their homes.”<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>In fact, the state’s senior senator had considerable gratuitous advice
for Governor Faubus. “If I were governor of Arkansas,” said Johnston,
“I would ignore the President and call out the National Guard
in the name of the State of Arkansas to defend life and property and
to defend the state against all alien influences and forces especially
the NAACP and troublemakers who wish to force a division upon the
country.” From his Washington office the Senator told the press that
it was “a known fact that subversive elements in this country support
the NAACP in inflaming the issue of integration and their ultimate
goal is to conquer us through division. If the President were tolerant
of the tolerant South’s position and less tolerant of the intolerant
NAACP the grave situation at Little Rock would never have occurred.”<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Other South Carolina political leaders expressed themselves with
varying degrees of vigor on the Arkansas situation. In a prepared
speech at Bennettsville, elder South Carolina politician James F. Byrnes
voiced complete confidence in the President’s integrity but maintained
that he was being “misled” by Attorney General Brownell. He believed
that Governor Faubus had been vindicated by events and called
the assignment of Judge Davies to the case highly “unwise.” Byrnes
declared that the Arkansas affair was staged purely for political
reasons as a means of outbidding the Democrats for the Negro vote.
That South Carolina had avoided such difficulties resulted from the
high quality of Negro schools in the state—better than those provided
for whites—and the sensible attitude of the “real” Negro leaders. The
former governor called on the Southern states to desert their allegiance
to the Democratic Party and to unite for southern independent action.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>Byrnes’s call for southern political independence echoed the plea
made earlier by Farley Smith, leader of the South Carolina Independent
Democrats. By sending troops into Arkansas, said Smith, the President
had “succumbed to integration extremists” and “silenced the voice
of moderation and understanding.” Smith declared further: “We
are now fair game for every Negro baiter and South hater and wild-eyed
fanatic on both sides of this momentous question. God only
knows where this will all end. But one thing should be crystal clear
by now—the South has had enough.” With this last statement James
P. Richards, former South Carolina Congressman and Chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, agreed. “It’s about time they
realize that an issue like this can’t be handled by the federal government,”
he asserted. Richards, whose job it then was as President
Eisenhower’s roving ambassador to make friends for the United States
amongst the dark-skinned peoples of the Middle East, observed that
“the Russian provinces ... have a form of segregation between the
Russians and the others. When you ask why, they say because the
people prefer it that way.”<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>Governor Timmerman, who had sent a telegram of encouragement
to Governor Faubus, pointed out that the Little Rock incident could
never have occurred in South Carolina because of the state’s educational
segregation laws.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The same position was taken by State
Senator Marion Gressette who heads the state committee entrusted
with the preservation of racial segregation in the schools. The law of
South Carolina, Gressette pointed out, would automatically shut off
state funds to any school ordered by a court to accept a Negro and
also the school from which the latter came. “Our law ... would permit
a cooling off period in South Carolina,” Gressette observed. “Where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
we would go from there would depend upon the circumstances and no
one can predict what the circumstances would be.” He divulged that
his committee had a plan for such a contingency but refused to reveal
its contents. He did give notice, though, that the federal government
“would be absolutely helpless in trying to force a person or persons
into South Carolina schools. The federal government has no power
to compel the General Assembly of South Carolina to appropriate
funds for the operation of schools.”<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>Not all of Senator Gressette’s colleagues shared his opinion that
Little Rock couldn’t happen in South Carolina. On October 6th, Senator
John D. Long announced that the legislative delegation of Union
County had arranged the purchase of nine new Browning sub-machine
guns with 1000 rounds of ammunition to beat back “any invasion of
federal troops” such as took place at Little Rock. “Anyone violating
our laws,” said Long, “will be arrested, jailed and treated the same as
any other accused persons.” Senator Long was confident that Union
County Sheriff J. Harold Lamb and his eight deputies could handle any
situation that might arise.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>Of the many causes for which South Carolinians blamed the renewal
and intensification of the integration efforts of the 1950’s, few have
been more prominent than the economic. The integration drive of
the post-World War <abbr title="Two">II</abbr> period coincided, of course, with the unprecedented
industrial growth of the South. At the same time, national
labor organizations, which previously had made discouragingly little
progress in South Carolina, began increased “agitation” to unionize
the labor force of the state. Since essentially the same forces are
opposed to both integration and unionization, it is natural that these
two aspects of the new Yankee aggression should be presented to the
public as different phases of the same thing.</p>

<p>South Carolina’s principal industry is cotton textiles. Only a small
percentage of textile workers in the state are unionized and nowhere
does there exist equality of employment opportunities for Negroes in
South Carolina textiles. In fact state law on labor and employment
contains the following provisions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in the business of cotton textile
manufacturing in this state to allow or permit operatives, help and labor of different
races</p>

<p>(a) to labor and work together within the same room,</p>

<p>(b) to use the same doors of entrance and exit at the same time,</p>

<p>(c) to use and occupy the same pay ticket windows or doors for paying off its
operatives and laborers at the same time,</p>

<p>(d) to use the same stairway and windows at the same time, or,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
(e) to use at any time the same lavatories, toilets, drinking water buckets,
pails, cups, dippers or glasses.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>In blaming integration and unionization efforts on Northern jealousy
and resentment of Southern economic progress, the Anderson <cite>Independent</cite>
has been the leading voice in the state. The paper presents itself
as the friend and champion of the working man and, in truth, is prepared
to go much further than most South Carolinians in supporting
minimum wage laws, social security benefits, and other benefits for
the working classes. However, labor unions have no more implacable
an enemy. In stating its position on the connection between Republican
politics, organized labor and integration, the upcountry newspaper
declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We said then [1952], and repeat the opinion now, that the forces behind the
integration campaign are the true lineal descendants of Black Republicanism
that forced the South into secession and war in the 1860’s and for the same
reasons—money and industry.</p>

<p>In the 1850’s there were the Abolitionists. In the 1950’s there is the NAACP.
In the 1850’s the South’s economy was becoming too strong to suit New England
interests. In the 1950’s the migration of industry poses the same challenge to
the North and East.</p>

<p>The Republican party was founded upon Abolitionist agitation and the same
party today is staking its hopes of retaining power on the modern-day Abolitionists
who also are in unholy alliance with the big labor unions.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Shortly after making this statement, which exhibited lack of concern
for historical accuracy, the same newspaper further spelled out
its stand on organized labor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This time the issue is not the abolition of slavery. Rather, it is the demand
that industrial slavery in the form of labor unions be allowed to dictate the
allocation of industry and jobs.</p>

<p>The South’s position today in relation to the rest of the U. S. in its constitutional
resistance to integration may be strengthened by placing heavier emphasis upon
the fact that, unlike the 1850’s the South is on the side of liberty in a battle
against a peculiarly insidious type of slavery.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The <cite>Independent</cite> is by no means alone in speaking of the “conspiracy”
between the integrationists and organized labor. Lieutenant
Governor E. F. Hollings warned against the combined efforts of CIO
labor unions and New England politicians in collusion with the NAACP
to “cut the flow of industry” into South Carolina and the South. Likewise,
Attorney General T. C. Callison hinted at “some unholy alliance
between the NAACP and enemies of ours who would be rejoiced to
bring about the condition of confusion, which would interfere with the
migration of industry to our state.”<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Shortly after Congress’ passage
of the Civil Rights Act the <cite>News and Courier</cite> ran the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
editorial note under the title of “Know Your Enemy”: “Every South
Carolinian who is employed in a textile mill should know that William
Pollock, president of the Textile Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO,
has petitioned President Eisenhower to appoint immediately
civil rights commissioners for the South. The man who wants to
collect the dues of textile workers in South Carolina can’t wait for
the New Reconstruction to begin.”<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>National labor unions have been, of course, among the most consistent
and militant supporters of full civil rights for Negroes. This
fact, together with such actions by the national unions as condemning
the activities of the Citizens Councils, have been used against the
cause of organized labor. The <cite>News and Courier</cite> commented with much
validity that the “traditional viewpoint” of Southerners on separation
of the races accounted for the resistance to labor organization in the
state. South Carolina’s industrial workers, it maintained, would have
to choose between heeding “the orders of union officials who are brainwashed
with the popular creed of mixing the races” and declaring
“their independence as free citizens.” Noting that the South was traditionally
“pro-segregation and anti-union,” it declared that to the
“union member who has already parted with one tradition the question
is whether he can part with the second, and still be accepted in the
community.” In a not very subtle attempt to alienate the South Carolina
worker from the labor union, the <cite>News and Courier</cite> declared that
“the white man who wishes to preserve his culture, his civilization, as
he and his fathers knew it, is in the minority as the national union
labor leaders count noses.”<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>Anti-union elements have been not unsuccessful in using for their
own ends the pro-integration stand of national labor unions and their
leaders. In some areas union members support Citizens Councils or
other white supremacy groups. And the implication of statements by
a number of labor leaders in the state, notably among those of the
Textile Workers Union of America, is that these members put loyalty
to the Citizens Councils above that of their labor unions. Oversimplifying
the case, Representative John Calhoun Hart of Union, one of
the leaders of a weak and unsuccessful effort to repeal the state’s right-to-work
law, told George Meany, president of the AFL-CIO: “Organized
labor will never make any substantial progress in the South
until national labor leaders stop uttering such rot and drivel on racial
matters in the South. Any Southerner who would go along with you
on such things is not worth his salt and could not be elected dogcatcher.”<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>One of the most curious developments in the integration controversy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
has been the creation of the United Southern Employes Association,
a pro-segregation labor organization imported from North Carolina.
Leaders of the new labor group acknowledged that they were reacting
against the pro-integration tendencies of the old unions and against
“the trend toward concentration of too much power in the hands of
‘a few big-shots.’” Applicants for membership were required to sign
a promise to attempt “in a legal manner, to maintain and support the
Southern tradition of segregation in education and society of the white
and Negro races without discriminating against or violating the civil
rights of any other person or persons.” The movement also aimed at
the establishment of a member-controlled labor movement and the
bringing about of “good friendship” and good relations between workers
and industries. The United Southern Employes Association supported
amendments to the state’s right-to-work law which would require
the approval by secret ballot of union members before any strike
could be called by a local union, thus preventing “wildcat strikes by
unions without the approval of their members”; prohibit national or
international unions from levying more than a seventy cents per month
tax on members without membership approval by secret ballot; ban
a national or international union from controlling local funds or property;
require membership approval, by secret ballot, of all contracts
and work agreements before such become binding; allow any union
member to withdraw his membership upon ten days notice to the local
union; and require that union members be notified ten days in advance
of any union elections; investigate labor disputes; and in general
serve as a state labor board. Though the dedication of such an organization
to the real welfare of the working class might be questioned,
the United Southern Employes Association presented itself as labor’s
hope in the South. By early 1957 the group had only one office in the
state, at Rock Hill, but it had grandiose plans for establishment of
others.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>The close association of the United Southern Employes Association
with conservative elements in the state came to light in January, 1957,
when W. A. Somersett, one of its organizers, was asked to address the
meeting in Columbia of the South Carolina Independent political movement.
Somersett presented the Association as being dedicated to the
preservation of racial segregation. He condemned the national Democratic
party as being “socialist” and listening overmuch “to persons
such as Walter Reuther.”<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>Somersett descended a few steps down the South Carolina social
ladder when he addressed a meeting of the Fort Mill Klan Klavern.
According to a report by the American Civil Liberties Union, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
asserted that any klansman was automatically considered a member
of the USEA and could be sent across an AFL-CIO picket line. This
statement, it is said, was greeted by a chorus of boos and a walkout of
most of the klansmen who were themselves textile operators.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>Thus the segregationist elements of the state reacted to the diverse
phases of the renewed war of Yankee aggression. It is a war in which
the South appears doomed to lose again, although at a much slower
pace than the struggle of the 1860’s. The growing disagreements between
North and South spotlight the ever increasing isolation of the
latter, not only in the nation but in the free world. It is evident,
by 1958, that the time has come for Southerners to undergo an “agonizing
reappraisal” of their traditional concepts of the relationships
between the races. It is also evident, however, that South Carolina’s
white spokesmen are not yet prepared to do this. On the face of things
it appears that white South Carolinians would settle down to a long
and slow process of chopping off the dog’s tail a bit at a time: The
end result will not change but the process will be much more painful.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent10 unindent">As for the local liberal—there are not too many among
us. Either they are idealistic, good hearted people who
have been led astray; or they are exhibitionists with
the warped idea that to be “progressive” is to destroy
all experience and teaching the centuries have given

</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Only a small proportion of South Carolina’s white population, it
would appear, has accepted the Supreme Court’s desegregation decision
in good faith. In any event few whites have been willing to
face “the venom of extremism and give expression to right and reality.”
At most “some ministers, fewer newspapers, an occasional public figure,
and some proper public organizations” have spoken out affirmatively
with respect to the Court ruling.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> The effectiveness of their efforts
has been even more limited than their number. Two of the most important
individuals who advocated compliance with the decision, Dean
Chester C. Travelstead of the University of South Carolina School of
Education and <cite>Morning News</cite> Editor Jack H. O’Dowd, were both forced
out of their positions. Similarly, those clergymen who have accepted
and have been vocally articulate regarding the Court ruling have been
subjected in some instances to strong pressures. Several have been
obliged to give up their pastorates.</p>

<p>Extreme segregationists recognize that those Southerners who urge
acceptance of the decision are a greater potential threat than “outside
agitators.” Consequently they direct some of their sharpest attacks
against these Southern moderates. (The term moderate is used here
to designate those South Carolinians who accept the Court decision
as the law of the land and urge its implementation with varying degrees
of speed. They range from those who would begin the process
of integration at once to those who simply accept the decision but
would delay implementation.) James F. Byrnes, the state’s “elder
statesman,” disparaged the moderates as “‘appeasers’ comparable to
the ‘scalawags’ of Reconstruction.” He fumed against those white
Southerners who were “so anxious for unity of a political party” that
they would surrender in the fight for continued segregation.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, the principal newspaper critic of the moderates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
believed too many Southerners were inclined to “swallow unwholesome
and impractical poisons” dispensed by Northern liberals.
Editor Thomas R. Waring castigated those elements of the Southern
press which were lending “solace to the do-gooders.” Such “scalarags”
(<i lang="la">sic</i>), according to Waring, did “not represent the sentiments of the
vast majority of the Southern people” and their editors might “live to
regret their betrayal.” The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, indeed, did not contend
that “all editors should think” as it thought; nevertheless, it said,
there came “a time to be counted.” “Timid newspapers, showing signs
of brainwashing by do-gooders and eggheads,” were causing the North
to misjudge the temper of the South on the segregation question, thus
doing a disservice to the South as well as the North. In a none too
oblique attack on the moderates, the <cite>News and Courier</cite> pointed out
that “in certain European countries during World War <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, some natives
‘collaborated’ with the enemy. They got better food rations. Others
resisted. Some of these were imprisoned. Some were tortured or
shot.”<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>The sentiments of the <cite>News and Courier</cite> were repeated throughout
the state. Dorothy Moore Guess of White Hall, a biology, history
and Sunday school teacher, had this advice for the moderates:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>To all those who do not like American free enterprise and dependence on
the individual, I say go back to socialistic England, Sweden, or to lands dominated
by Russian communism. To all those who do not like life in South Carolina
as native South Carolinians have shaped it, I say, leave immediately for New
York, Michigan, California, Oregon or any other state that you believe to be
an improvement on South Carolina.</p>

<p>The Garden of Eden was a wonderful place as long as Adam and Eve accepted
it as it was. South Carolinians, and Americans in general, should think well before
they destroy forever their own gardens of freedom.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>According to the <cite>News and Courier</cite> the appeal of the moderates
stemmed from a misunderstanding and faulty definition of the term
“moderate” and the consequent gulf which existed between Northern
and Southern moderates. It recognized the existence of a “group of
Southerners who call themselves moderates.” This group believed
that the decision was the law of the land and that integration was
inevitable and hence ought to be accepted in good grace. Such persons
were “mere echoes of the Northern moderates” and represented only
a small minority of “white Southern opinion.” According to the
Charleston paper’s understanding of the term, a Southern moderate
was one who believed that there was no “valid law requiring states to
mix the races in their schools” and who thought the Supreme Court
had exceeded its authority in declaring segregation unconstitutional.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
The Southern moderate maintained that integration wasn’t legal and
that the South wouldn’t attempt it. “So why don’t you meddlesome
Yankees be reasonable men of good will and let us alone,” he would
ask. The <cite>News and Courier</cite> included in the category of Southern
moderates not only itself but also “Southern Legislatures which have
passed interposition resolutions, ... senators and representatives
who recently signed the historic [anti-integration] manifesto in Washington”
and most members of the Citizens Councils. To surrender to
the integrationists was not moderation; it was “acceptance of racial
suicide” for the Southern white people.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>The organization in the state which concerns itself most prominently
with interracial understanding is the South Carolina Council on Human
Relations. It was affiliated with the Southern Regional Council, an
association dedicated to “equal opportunity for all peoples of the
South,” and has been financed in part by the Fund for the Republic.
The South Carolina Council has no specific solution to the segregation
issue but has expressed the conviction that the answer would “demand
the best thought and action from responsible leaders of both races.”
It maintains, however, that “the state must move in the direction of
compliance with the Supreme Court decision.” Sparkplug of the organization
is Mrs. Alice N. Spearman of Columbia, formerly executive
director of the South Carolina Federation of Women’s Clubs. The
Rev. J. Claude Evans, editor of the South Carolina Methodist <cite>Christian
Advocate</cite>, was the Council’s president until 1957 when he was succeeded
by Courtney Siceloff of Frogmore. The Council has fewer than
a half dozen local chapters throughout the state. The most active is
at Sumter. The Rock Hill chapter has been “stimulated” by a strongly
anti-segregationist Catholic priest, the Very Rev. Maurice Shean. In
Rock Hill the Council enjoyed a degree of official recognition since
former Mayor Emmette Jerome, now a member of the state House
of Representatives, was a member of the state board and appointed
a Mayor’s Committee on Human Relations.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>South Carolina had a few other similar but short-lived organizations.
In Anderson a Christian Council of Human Relations was established
in July, 1954. An interracial association, it adopted a declaration
of principles which asserted that the Supreme Court decision was “in
keeping with the highest traditions of American justice and freedom....
[and was] consistent with the spirit and teaching of Jesus
of Nazareth.” The practical question confronting the state, according
to the Council, was “not whether the Court was socially wise or legally
correct in their judgment.” Rather the problem was how best to adjust
to the decision in such a way “that the majesty and force of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
law may be upheld and good will among men may be advanced.” Good
faith in implementing the decision would “relieve the conscience of
many white Christians who have long been uneasy and troubled by
conflict between the teaching of Jesus and the inequalities of our racial
situation.”<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>Another such group is the South Carolina chapter of United
Church Women. This organization, which, in truth, has little influence,
is composed of women from most Protestant denominations.
Mrs. James M. Dabbs of Maysville is state president. In a letter
to Governor Byrnes shortly after the original desegregation decision,
Mrs. Dabbs declared that “enforced segregation had no place in Christian
activity and constituted a very real threat to our Democracy.”<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>The position which these organizations have held in the state has
not been particularly enviable. Commented the Rev. J. Claude Evans:
“I think the solution is a long term process of human relations down
the moderate road. At the moment, the moderates are not very popular
and walk a razor’s edge.” The moderates, he observed, would
have “to bide their time” until “the legal aspects” of segregation were
clarified and “the social attitudes of the people jell.”<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>The plight of those who urge moderation was further illustrated
in the summer of 1957 when five Protestant ministers from the Pee
Dee section of the state organized themselves into a group called
“Concerned South Carolinians.”<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> They were the Reverends John
Lyles, Presbyterian of Marion; John Morris, Episcopalian of Dillon;
Joseph Horn, Episcopalian of Florence; Larry Jackson, Methodist of
Florence; and Ralph Cousins, Episcopalian of Marion. The Concerned
South Carolinians issued a prospectus of their aims and objectives.
They urged publication of a booklet of articles written by
prominent Carolinians pleading for moderation in the race controversy—“a
course between the excesses of certain Citizens Councils,
on the one hand, and extreme actions of the NAACP [<i lang="la">sic</i>] on the other
hand.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We feel [declared the prospectus] that extreme positions have dominated
the picture in our state. Organized groups are feeding the flames of racial hate.
We believe, however, that a large group of South Carolinians disagree with these
positions on the racial problem. We desperately need the leadership of men and
women who will debate the issues rationally, who will counter the voices of
extremism with words of moderation, and who will have the humility and courage
to see a goal in the future toward which we in South Carolina must be working
gradually.</p>

<p>... It is imperative that persons in South Carolina who are honored and
respected in their several communities speak words of calmness and moderation.
This is the conviction which has drawn us together as ministers of Christ and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
concerned citizens of South Carolina. We also believe that you are such a leader
as is now needed and that you may share some of this concern.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>The ministers continued by stating their basic beliefs and assumptions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. That God created all men in His own image and therefore all races are
equal in His sight.</p>

<p>2. That although there is no “superior” race certain differences are to be
recognized because of environment, but these differences are not due to an
inherent inferiority.</p>

<p>3. That the public school system must be maintained for all the people.</p>

<p>4. That any solution to the present dilemma must be sought within the framework
of Supreme Court decisions, which are legally binding and morally valid.</p>

<p>5. That, nevertheless, cultural patterns cannot be changed quickly and the
reality of this cannot wisely be ignored in seeking solutions.</p>

<p>6. That neither of the extreme pressures of the NAACP nor the Citizens
Councils offers the best direction for the South.</p>

<p>7. That personal freedom of choice and association in social relations must be
maintained within the bounds of a democratic society, even if desegregation
becomes the accepted procedure for tax supported institutions.</p>

<p>8. That all Southerners should explore the situation thoughtfully in the light
of Christian love and our democratic heritage, believing that we can go forward
together even though slowly.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Sentiments such as these, of course, had little chance of winning
friends and influencing segregationists in South Carolina. Among
those receiving the prospectus was Governor Timmerman. Although
specifically asked not to make the contents of the prospectus public,
the Governor handed his copy to the press. He explained his action
in the following manner: “In the belief that it is of interest generally
to the public, I am making it [the prospectus] available for publication.
All South Carolinians, not just these self-appointed few, are
‘Concerned’ South Carolinians.”</p>

<p>The Florence Citizens Council wasted little time in replying to the
“Concerned South Carolinians.” In a press release, it accused the
clergymen of organizing “under a cloak of secrecy” and boasted by
way of comparison that it was an “open” association. The Florence
Council maintained that the ministers misrepresented the facts in
classifying it as an “extremist” organization along with the NAACP.
It challenged the “Concerned South Carolinians” or any other group
“to prove when and where the Citizens Councils have acted contrary
to law or in extreme.”<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>When the publication of the “Concerned South Carolinians” finally
came out in October, it had a brisk sale.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> The very fact that it appeared
on newsstands throughout the state was in itself a victory for
its sponsors. Former Congressman James P. Richards praised publication
of the booklet as a “real contribution to freedom of expression.”<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Few South Carolina whites, however, saw fit to endorse the pamphlet
and from public officials, aside from Richards, there was a wall of dead
silence.</p>

<p>The booklet contained a dozen essays or statements ranging from
the old fashioned segregationist arguments of Columbia attorney, R.
Beverley Herbert, to the hard hitting integrationist editorials of Arthur
Locke King, another attorney, from Georgetown, and Andrew McDowd
Secrest, the outspoken editor and publisher of the weekly <cite>Cheraw
Chronicle</cite>. Anthony Harrigan, reviewing the booklet for the <cite>News
and Courier</cite>, found little of value in the collection of opinions save
in the case of Mr. Herbert’s essay. The other authors, he maintained,
did not represent the views of South Carolinians as were expressed at
elections.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>Among the contributors to the little volume was Mrs. Claudia
Thomas Sanders, wife of a Gaffney physician. Mrs. Sanders suggested
that desegregation could be accomplished in the public schools of the
state by starting with the first grades. “Children are not born with
prejudice,” wrote Mrs. Sanders. “If adults could only learn from
children their ability to judge character and worth without regard for
externals,” she continued, the desegregation process “would be immeasurably
lighter.”<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>No one could accuse Mrs. Sanders of being one of those Northerners
who could never understand the “Southern way of life.” Born in
Charleston, the state’s “Holy City,” she can trace her ancestry back
to the early colonial period. Moreover, she is a leading Episcopal
churchwoman and is engaged in such eminently socially acceptable
activities as the American Association of University Women, the Home
and Garden Club, the Gaffney Hospital Auxiliary and the Cherokee
County Public Library Board.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>But Mrs. Sanders had not counted on possible retaliatory action on
the part of white supremacy bedsheet brigadiers who haunt the upper
part of the state. On the night of November 19th an explosion rocked
the Sanders house tearing a gaping hole near the chimney, breaking
six windows, and cracking a wall in the living room. Dr. and Mrs.
Sanders and their house guests, Mr. and Mrs. Carl B. McLaughlin of
Louisville, Kentucky, were in another part of the house at the time
of the explosion and escaped injury.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>Police officials investigating the explosion discovered that this was
the third attempt to dynamite the Sanders home, two other efforts
having failed because of the bungling of the perpetrators. Moreover,
within three weeks the State Law Enforcement Division had arrested
five men in connection with the bombing. With all due respect to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
the extremely efficient SLED, it required neither a Sherlock Holmes
nor a Dick Tracy to track down the culprits, for the trail led directly
to a Ku Klux Klan group operating in the area. The five men arrested
were factory workers and mill hands. Their ages ranged from
twenty-four to thirty-five.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>“Respectable” South Carolinians were appropriately shocked by
the Gaffney episode and newspaper editorials uniformly called for
the arrest of the culprits and later expressed satisfaction when they
were apprehended. Yet few if any of the public officials in the state,
who were so vocal on the Little Rock “oppression,” saw fit to comment
on the bombing, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the Reverend
John B. Morris of Dillon, one of the clergymen who helped prepare
the “Concerned South Carolinians” booklet. In a letter to papers
throughout the state the Reverend Morris, who opposes immediate
integration in the public schools of the deep South, wrote: “When
big men in public office have hitherto talked loosely on the race issue,
very little men have been incited to plan acts of violence. The big
men deplore the violence and realize it only hurts their cause, but
until they use their influence before the violence occurs, they bear
some responsibility for it. When the emotions of simple folk are
stirred by emotional talk from public figures, they come to feel that
they must take the law into their own hands. Let segregationist politicians
realize they can maintain their position calmly and with reason.
Otherwise incendiary talk will prompt incendiary action.”<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>The arrest of the five men in no sense chastened them or made them
realize the enormity of their act. Nor did the Klan seek to cover its
tracks in the affair. On the contrary, the local Klansmen held a rally
at Blacksburg to collect funds to defray the cost of the legal defense
of the accused, two of whom, Luther E. Boyette and Robert P. Martin,
openly boasted of their affiliation with the nightshirt brigade. Present
at the rally, attended by 20 robed Klansmen and approximately 250
onlookers, was the grand dragon of the South Carolina Independent
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. “We do not wish Mrs. James H.
Sanders any harm,” he told the crowd. “If we could, we would send
her back [sic] to Africa so she would be with her Negro friends.” The
Independent Klan would back the accused “all the way,” he asserted.
“They have already proved their innocence so far as I am concerned,
and of course the first consideration was in proving it to the Klan.”<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>James McBride Dabbs, whose wife is president of the state United
Church Women, has also been prominent in the activities of interracial
groups. He is president of the Southern Regional Council. Immediately
after the original decision, Dabbs, a one time college professor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
urged South Carolinians to “proceed now to implement this ruling
with whatever skill and wisdom we have.” He considered segregation
“nonsense” and believed that under desegregation “Negroes would still
associate almost entirely with Negroes, white people with white people.”
The row over desegregation, he maintained, was a tempest in a teapot.
It is time “for the white man to realize that he is just a human being;
he’s been playing God so long,” declared this modern Old Testament
prophet. “The majority of white South Carolinians today are waging
a fight which they will lose as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow, and
about which, when they have lost it, they will wonder why they fought
so hard to stave off so small a change.”<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. G. Jackson Stafford, who was pastor of the First Baptist
Church of Batesburg until his resignation was forced, typifies in a
very real sense those clergymen who opposed segregation. He believed
that the Court decision was “in keeping with the constitutional
guarantee of equal freedom to all citizens, and ... in harmony with
the Christian principles of equal justice and love for all men.” But
he also realized that “the people of the South need time to become
adjusted to the changing social and political climate with regard to
race relations.” Racial tensions, he believed, would be greatly reduced
if the politicians would cease their efforts to make a political
football out of the problems involved in improving race relations.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>Occasionally other South Carolinians publicly expressed support
for integration. John Bolt Culbertson, a Greenville attorney who had
“been interested in liberal causes and in the labor movement” since
his student days at the University of South Carolina, was a strong
supporter of the NAACP. He considered the denial of “the fundamentals
of democratic government” to Negroes a “mockery” of democracy.
In a similar vein D. M. Harrelson of Gresham protested
“as a Southern white man” against the “Nazi-Ku Klux Klan climate”
fostered in the South by “demagogic politicians, citizens committees,
[and] a Metropolitan press.” This agitation, he felt, appealed “to
the ignorant, unthinking, whose minds are filled with native prejudice.”
E. M. Martin of Charleston, too, was critical of segregation. “Any
institution supported by public funds ought to be for all citizens excluding
none,” he thought. Segregated school systems were “contrary
to the Constitution of the United States.” Another Charlestonian, W.
Ernest Douglas, believed that “most white people have such a terrific
mental block concerning segregation that, in this matter at least, they
forfeit their right to be called rational animals. They become simple
animals moving in whatever direction their herders prod them.”<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>The influence of the segregation issue on freedom of thought in South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
Carolina was illustrated by the nationally publicized Travelstead affair.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
Dr. Chester C. Travelstead, a native of Kentucky, was appointed
Dean of the School of Education of the University of South
Carolina in 1953. According to Dr. Travelstead, he made known to
University President Donald S. Russell his views on segregation before
his appointment. With the developing resistance to integration in the
period following the Supreme Court’s ruling, Travelstead became “distressed
to observe that only one side of this whole issue was being
presented to the public.” He believed that segregation deprived the
Negro of his “right to first class citizenship.” Even more important,
he felt that South Carolina was “fast developing an autocratic police
state.” In the late spring of 1955, he decided to speak his piece.</p>

<p>In April Governor George Bell Timmerman Jr. had addressed the
South Carolina Education Association and strongly condemned attempts
at integration. Shortly thereafter Travelstead wrote a long
and, on the face of it, imprudent letter to the Governor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>You said in your speech, Governor, that “the opinion of the Supreme Court of
the United States in the school-segregation cases upholds for the first time in
judicial history that equality of treatment is discriminatory.” It is my considered
opinion, Governor, that it was not the intent of the Court to say that
“equality of treament is discriminatory.” Rather did it say in effect that segregation
is in and of itself discriminatory....</p>

<p>You have said, Governor, that the recommendation [to the General Assembly
of South Carolina] to abolish the [state’s] Compulsory Attendance Law “has
not weakened ourselves in this respect.” Apparently, Governor, it is the firm
belief of most educators and leaders in state and national government that compulsory
school attendance at public or private schools has been the backbone
of our democracy.</p>

<p>You have attacked, Governor, the integrationist and have said that he is
“seeking to abolish parental rights in education....” It is without evidence to
say that those who in 1955, for moral, civic, and legal reasons believed that
segregation is outmoded and should therefore be abolished are men of “little
character” attempting, as you say, “to lynch the character of a fourth of our
nation.” It is my opinion, Governor, that many men of great stature are sincerely
convinced that the Supreme Court’s ruling was both timely and sound....</p>

<p>You have said: “No precedent, no parallel, can be found for compulsory integration.
It is new. It is novel. It is contrary to the divine order of things.
Only an evil mind can conceive it. Only a foolish mind can accept it.”</p>

<p>It seems to me that there are many parallels and precedents....</p>

<p>... Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia do have school systems
in which the races are integrated. The other 17 states, now practicing segregation
of the races in their schools, still practice compulsory integration within each
race by requiring that boys and girls of widely different socio-economic and
cultural backgrounds go to the same schools in spite of these differences.</p>

<p>It is my opinion, therefore, that the phrases, “evil mind” and “foolish mind,”
quoted above, have been ill used and are without foundation.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
On May 31 President Russell, while not advising Travelstead to
desist from writing such letters, cautioned him that “such controversial
matters make politicians mad.” Despite the argumentative
letter to the Governor, Travelstead was notified on July 28 of his reappointment
as education dean for the 1955-56 school year with a substantial
salary increase.</p>

<p>On August 2 Travelstead again attacked segregation. In a speech
before the student body of the summer school, he declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>As I study the Judaic-Christian concept prevalent in Western Civilization; as
I examine the bases of our own government—the Bill of Rights and all other
pronouncements of our forefathers—I find nothing which requires, justifies, or
even allows a notion of second class citizenship for any group. I find no conclusive
evidence that one group of men is foreordained to be superior or inferior
to other groups of men. I find that this notion of race and national superiority
came to ruinous end in Nazi Germany. For races or nations of men to think
and act upon the assumption that all other groups are inferior is to invite
disaster and downfall.... The fact that we have practiced segregation on the
assumption that it was right and just, does not <em>make</em> it right and just.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Three days later President Russell told Travelstead that he had
received complaints concerning the speech. (It is generally presumed
that these came from the Governor’s office). Two weeks later, August
19, Travelstead received notification of his dismissal as Dean. “The
executive committee of the board of trustees,” it said, “is of the opinion
that it is not in the best interest of the university to renew your appointment
as Dean of the School of Education.” At a hearing before
the executive committee which Travelstead requested, the committee
allegedly told him that persons employed by the university should not
engage in discussion of controversial issues. In response to Travelstead’s
request that the committee issue a statement with respect to
its policy concerning academic freedom and free discussion by university
employes, the committee refused. According to Travelstead, the
committee replied that “a person should have enough common sense
to know what he should and should not discuss—without any clear-cut
policy about such matters.” Following his dismissal as Dean, Travelstead
received an appointment as Education Dean at the University
of New Mexico.</p>

<p>Reaction of the student body of the university to Travelstead’s dismissal
was varied.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> The <cite>Gamecock</cite>, the student newspaper, and most
of its columnists strongly condemned the action. So did a majority
of those students who expressed their opinion in letters to the <cite>Gamecock</cite>
editor. However at least one columnist and a number of the
letters to the editor supported the dismissal. Editor Carolyn McClung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
considered the dismissal “a hard and definite blow to the University.”
If University officials took upon themselves to squelch persons with
unpopular ideas, it was “no place for students with intellectual curiosity.”
Similarly, columnist Herbert Bryant believed that “the University’s
escutcheon” bore a deep scar as a result of the trustees’ apparent
“ban on freedom of academic thought and expression at the
University.” Jack Bass, another columnist, considered the action
“rash and shortsighted.” He believed that “at least 90 percent” of
the University faculty agreed with the sentiments expressed by Dr.
Travelstead; hence, the Dean was fired not for having an opinion but
for expressing it openly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, columnist Billy Mellette supported the removal
of Travelstead: “People who work for any university or college know
they must be careful, or they should know it. You say the policy is
not written, and how then are you expected to know what to say?—You
use your damned head, that’s how you know. The school doesn’t
go around sneaking up on people and trying to find people to fire....
If he [Travelstead] did not know to be quiet—as head of the education
department of all positions—then he has now learned.... The University
did not invade the castle of free thought. It was challenged
and forced to commit itself.”</p>

<p>In a similar vein Fred LeClerq respected Travelstead’s “right as an
individual to believe in integration,” but he did not think that he
should “occupy a position through which he could mold the opinions of
prospective teachers of a state where race purity and segregation are
essential to the well-being of its citizens.” LeClerq believed “integration
to be as diametrically opposed to the welfare of this state as
communism is to the welfare of the nation.” For this reason he thought
the ouster both “justifiable and commendable.”</p>

<p>Supporters of segregation generally upheld the board of trustees.
The <cite>News and Courier</cite> pointed out that the issue of academic freedom
had two sides—“the freedom of a professor to speak his mind” and “the
freedom of a university to choose the lines of education it wishes to
follow.” Since Travelstead was out of line with both university policy
and the desires of the people of South Carolina, his usefulness as a
teacher was over. “He easily can exercise his academic freedom elsewhere,”
concluded the Charleston paper.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the <cite>Morning News</cite> was critical. Editor O’Dowd
stated that if the university were “to teach conformity in all schools
of thought” it would no longer be a university. It would then be “a
machine for making mimeographed mentalities.... If the University
of South Carolina rejects a valuable educator because he has one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
unpopular idea, then our university is not a place for hungry minds.”<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>A second notable example of this urge to conformity was the case
of Jack H. O’Dowd himself. The nephew of <cite>Morning News</cite> publisher
John M. O’Dowd, he almost alone amongst South Carolina news editors
had attempted to steer a middle course in the segregation controversy.
His difficulties were testimony to the fate of an honest and
courageous dissenter. A native of Florence and a graduate of the
Citadel, O’Dowd termed himself not a pro-integrationist but an anti-pro-segregationist.</p>

<p>Under O’Dowd’s editorship the <cite>Morning News</cite>, as already has been
noted, opposed all attempts to destroy the “social necessity” of segregation
by court order. If segregation were to be eliminated, it had
to be done “by the consent of the people and as a result of an evolutionary
process.” Segregation was incorrectly defended on the grounds
of states rights and constitutionalism. Such arguments indicated to
the rest of the world that American democracy meant that “all men
are equal but some are less equal than others.”</p>

<p>The Florence editor accepted the decision as the law of the land
and urged his readers to do likewise. Since segregation was illegal,
it was only a matter of time before it would be a thing of the past.
Public schools would have to be desegregated. Those who were thinking
in terms of continued segregation under a system of voluntary
separation were engaging in “self-delusion and false hope.” “Within
too short a period of time,” segregation would be “a legal memory”
in the South. Desegregation was not a problem to be considered “in
some hazy tomorrow”; it had to be confronted immediately. A policy
of adopting expedients, which could at best provide only temporary
segregation, would not change the final picture but it would make it
more painful and expensive. There had to be a maximum price beyond
which the South would be unwilling to go to preserve segregation
temporarily.</p>

<p>During the period of adjustment to changes wrought by the Court
decision, the greatest danger confronting South Carolina, warned
O’Dowd, was “the growth of a new era of demagoguery.” Such would
allow “the great racial issue to get out of perspective and past the
point of sane solution.” Too many segregationists were already “advocating
something akin to secession.” O’Dowd insisted that there
was a difference between “honest opposition to the Court’s decree and
demagogic reaction that borders on sedition and violates the respect
and honor implicit in the theories of our national government.”<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>In early 1956 O’Dowd made what were to be his last clarion calls
to common sense and level-headed thinking on the segregation issue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
On February 26 he appealed for a policy of “militant moderation” to
counter the extremists. The latter were carrying the day. Extremists,
crying “traitor,” “coward” or “brainwashed,” discredited all attempts
at moderation. Casting a plague on the houses of both white
supremacists and the NAACP, O’Dowd believed that most South
Carolinians must know “that truth and proper action lies between the
sentiments” of these groups. The only true solution was for the
moderates to step forth and lead the way.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>O’Dowd’s plea went unheeded. Instead, the <cite>Morning News</cite> became
more and more the object of extremist wrath. The young editor
received a threatening telephone call from a man who identified himself
as “the Klan.” Attempts were made to force off the road both
his car and that of assistant sports editor L. B. Ballard. The latter,
who was also a Baptist minister, had the rear tires of his car slashed.
City editor Charles Moore was “punched” and chased from a Klan
meeting which he was covering for the paper. In February 1956 the
<cite>Morning News</cite>, for the first time in several years, experienced a drop in
circulation. Reader complaints mounted. The Florence County
Democratic convention denounced the <cite>Morning News</cite> as a “carpetbagger
press.” O’Dowd, nominated as a candidate for delegate to
the state Democratic convention, ran 45th in a field of 45.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>On March 11 in a lengthy editorial, O’Dowd announced his “retreat
from reason.” Because of pressure from white supremacists and
silence from the moderates, the <cite>Morning News</cite> would no longer discuss
segregation in its editorial columns:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In order for a newspaper to maintain its proper position of influence for good,
its editorial policy must meet with good will and its position must be accepted
as expressions of good faith.</p>

<p>Such has not been the case with this newspaper’s expressions of opinion in the
field of segregation. It is now possible that the lack of support gained for this
position could lessen the paper’s effectiveness in other fields of thought and action.</p>

<p>To avoid this possibility, the <cite>Morning News</cite> must make a retreat from reason.
It has become obvious that to maintain effectiveness in other important areas
of thought, this newspaper must abdicate its position in the segregation controversy....</p>

<p>Our editorials have never advocated integration. Our editorials have opposed
NAACP extremism as militantly as they have opposed absolutism on the other
side of the equation....</p>

<p>Men seeking the fair solution have not, in two years, come forward. They do
not exist or they have been unwilling to face the scorn and abuse of those in the
extreme fringes of both groups.</p>

<p>Only the few extremists have spoken; and their voice has been accepted as
that of the majority. Moderation has been intimidated by hatred, and men of
calm, good will have decided that the fight is not their concern.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
... Today’s South is becoming dominated by those unable or unwilling to
accept the good sense or even good faith of a conflicting or modifying idea.</p>

<p>... By and large, our appeal to reason has brought expressions of hatred,
bigotry, unreason and filth. Our plea for moderation has been greeted with
threats, lies, rumor and lack of good will. Our honest efforts to present the
news—as it happens—have met with charges of distortion and collusion and with
words of malice. Those who know better have not seen fit to consider this
fight their concern....</p>

<p>Most of those who would be heard in this matter are evidently unwilling to
hear thoughts of hope and peace. Editorials that do not speak sedition, bigotry,
white supremacy and incitation to legislative folly and physical violence are not
accepted as “honest” or “courageous.”<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Reaction varied to O’Dowd’s “retreat,” or more accurately his admission
of defeat. A number of letters to the editor expressed sympathy
with his moderation policy; others were highly critical. <cite>Time</cite>
magazine, in an article favorable to O’Dowd, brought to national
attention the plight of the <cite>Morning News</cite> and its editor. Praise by a
magazine such as <cite>Time</cite>, of course, merely increased the condemnation
of white supremacists. Joe B. Powell of Florence, for example, said
he “sure would hate to be on the side of TIME or any other lousy
YANKEE magazine or newspaper” while living in the South among
his “southern white friends.” Florentines, he said, were “sick and
fed up” with O’Dowd’s ideas on segregation. In line with the advice
of Dorothy Moore Guess to unhappy Southerners, he suggested that
O’Dowd “move to the North” where he would feel at home.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> The
<cite>News and Courier</cite> considered the whole affair “a grandstand play” to
enable O’Dowd to reap “publicity as an integrationist advocate.”<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>O’Dowd remained as editor of the <cite>Morning News</cite> until August 3
when he accepted a position on the news and editorial staff of the
Chicago <cite>Sun-Times</cite>. The announcement of his resignation contained
no mention of the segregation controversy. In the summer of 1957
he was appointed Dean of Students of the University of Chicago’s
university college.</p>

<p>In incidents such as these white South Carolina demonstrated its
opposition to those few white dissenters who would accept integration
or who would admit that there is an element of right on the side of
those who oppose the racial <i lang="la">status quo</i>.</p>

<p>In 1954 historian Francis B. Simkins told the Southern Historical
Association: “There is a reality about the South which historians
with egalitarian standards find hard to understand or appreciate.”
The South, said this native South Carolinian, should be judged by its
own standards, not those of a liberal, equalitarian, democratic America.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
Professor Simkins’ advice has <em>not</em> been followed in this study.</p>

<p>In contemplating the arguments advanced by white South Carolinians
against integrating the races on any level, one is struck by the
prominence given to expressions of fear that integration will inevitably
lead to wholesale “amalgamation” and/or “miscegenation” which will
result in turn in the destruction of Southern civilization. An excellent
example of this reasoning is contained in the late Herbert Ravenel
Sass’s article “Mixed Schools and Mixed Blood,” which appeared in
the November 1956 issue of the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>. “It is the deep
conviction of nearly all white Southerners,” Sass wrote, “that the
mingling or integration of white and Negro children in the South’s
primary schools would open the gates to miscegenation and widespread
racial amalgamation.” To guard against this “danger,” he
declared, Southerners would maintain segregation in public schools
at all costs. “The South must do this because, although it is a nearly
universal instinct, race preference is not active in the very young.
Race preference (which the propagandists miscall race prejudice or
hate) is one of those instincts which develop gradually as the mind
develops and which, if taken in hand early enough, can be prevented
from developing at all.” If the South allowed its small children to
attend integrated schools in which white and colored would be “brought
together intimately and constantly” there would be many “in whom
race preference would not develop.” This would be the ultimate
tragedy for the South and for civilization. For “a very few years of
thoroughly integrated schools would produce large numbers of indoctrinated
young Southerners free from all ‘prejudice’ against mixed
matings.” Negro leaders, he concluded, desired racial amalgamation;
“they not only want the right to amalgamate through legal intermarriage
but they want that right to be exercised widely and frequently.”<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
The concern of South Carolinians with the “threat” of intermarriage
is evidenced by the frequency with which this subject is mentioned in
letters to newspapers in the state. Though the logic and factual accuracy
of many of these letters leave something to be desired, they
none the less are illustrative of a state of mind. For example, W. A.
Morris of Charleston, referring to the mulattoes in the NAACP, said:
“In the animal kingdom the mongrel is despised and outlawed, the good
farmer uses only purebred stock and dog and cat fanciers insist on
pedigreed pets. Should we expect less of man, made in the image of
God, or attempt to improve on God’s work?”<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> Mr. Morris did not
make it exactly clear how both whites and blacks but not mulattoes
could be made in God’s image. Nor did he concern himself with how
mulattoes got to be what they are.</p>

<p>Sentiments similar to those of Morris were expressed by Mrs. S. L.
Blackman of Darlington: “Cross-bred animals lose the higher qualities
of the parent stock,” she asserted, “and the low qualities always come
to the fore. That’s a law of nature you can’t get away from.... If
segregation is broken down everywhere, this world will be peopled by
a mongrel race, eventually fit for nothing, not worth the air they
would breathe, just scum of the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Mrs. Blackman’s dogmatic
assertions are in direct contrast to the findings of the late Professor
Franz Boaz, America’s greatest cultural anthropologist. Concerning
attitudes such as those expressed by Mrs. Blackman, Boas wrote:
“The claim has been made ... that mixed races ... are inferior in
physical and mental qualities, that they inherit all the unfavorable
traits of the parental races. So far as I can see, this bold proposition
is not based on adequate evidence.” Going even further, he declared,
“The few cases in which it has been possible to gather strictly scientific
data on the physical characteristics of the half-bloods have rather
shown that there may be a certain amount of physical improvement
in the mixed race.”<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>Stanley F. Morse, a chronic letter-to-the-editor writer and prominent
in white supremacy circles, told the <cite>News and Courier</cite> that the
progeny of “uncontrolled [interracial] crossings are mongrels which
are more apt to be inferior than superior.” “The fall of the Egyptian,
Roman and other great civilizations,” he continued, “was largely due
to the development of a mongrel race caused by interbreeding with
slaves and ‘barbarians.’” Furthermore, “planned mongrelization of
a race in 740 B.C. produced the despised Samaritans.” Those who
would condone such mongrelization were “breaking the Divine Laws.”
Other writers also considered intermarriage a violation of the will of
God. Mrs. E. R. Mansfield of Mt. Pleasant, for example, wrote the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
<cite>News and Courier</cite> editor that “naturally this process of maintaining
racial purity and integrity at the same time that we make possible
equality of opportunity, is going to impose a hardship and some personal
tragedies, on some individuals. But this will not be the first
hard thing that God in His infinite goodness has demanded for us.”<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>Three principal conclusions result from this study: (1) South Carolina
has not yet embraced democracy as the term is generally defined
by Americans outside the South. (2) Many white South Carolinians
still accept a racism which in its most extreme forms approaches that
of Hitler and the Nazis. (3) Not a few of the arguments and defenses
advanced by segregationists against the Court decision are so illogical
and so riddled with inconsistencies that sometimes one is obliged to
question not only the sincerity but also the intelligence of the spokesmen.
These conclusions have been illustrated in the body of the study
but a short summary is in order.</p>

<p>The denial of equality of access or opportunity in any public area,
function or facility by a “superior” group to an “inferior” group constitutes
the antithesis of democracy. In this respect South Carolina,
like all of the Southern states, is undemocratic, a condition which
persons concerned with promoting integration have not failed to note.
Clarence Mitchell, the Washington NAACP official, referred to South
Carolina as “the frontier of democracy,” a place where “the real meaning
of America” had not penetrated.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>The attitude of leading segregation spokesmen regarding democracy
is more revealing than that of critics of the South. The <cite>News and
Courier</cite> is the state’s most articulate expert on the “phony spiels about
democracy.” The American people had gone “hog-wild in worshipping
‘democracy,’” complained this paper. Democracy with its “unrestricted
franchise” did not guarantee good government. Indeed there
was “ample precedent for requiring that those who vote on public
issues be able to understand” what they were doing. Property, too,
was a relevant qualification. George Washington himself had warned
against the “‘dangerous multitudes without property and without
principle.’” “Some persons” would object to the use of property as
a qualification for voting but property was “still a gauge of competence....
Paupers are and should be excluded from deciding how
other people’s money is to be spent.” Editor Thomas R. Waring’s
editorials also argued that majority rule might be the essence of democracy
but the United States was not a democracy. It was a republic.
A mob might be a majority at certain times. “The condemnation
of Jesus Christ had the approval of a majority. Throughout
the history of the church there have been martyrs of majorities.”<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
A democracy, according to the <cite>News and Courier</cite>, did not guarantee
protection of sectional or local interests. But the United States—“a
federal republic”—was especially designed for this end. Under the
American constitutional system the parts were supposed to be equal
to the whole. In this sense then it was not “the democratic way to
force the majority of the people of a REGION to live in a manner
that is repugnant to them. The democratic way should take into
consideration the local as well as the national feelings of citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
John C. Calhoun never better expressed these sentiments.</p>

<p>The <cite>Record</cite>, too, abhorred “absolute democracy.” The United
States was never intended to be such. It was “a limited representative
democracy.” The <cite>Record</cite> deplored constitutional flexibility. It maintained
that the presumption on which the Supreme Court based its
decision outlawing school segregation, namely, that the Constitution
was “a growing document,” eliminated, “for all practical purposes,”
the Constitution as “a safeguard of the people’s purposes,” as “a
safeguard of the people’s rights and as a limitation upon government.”
The <cite>Record</cite> maintained that the integration problem arose from the
fact that “so many of the minority groups, who have been urging the
abolition of segregation and other such ‘reforms’” were “not inheritors
of the British tradition out of which the American Constitution grew.”
These groups saw nothing to be feared in constitutional amendments
by the Supreme Court. It was all “democracy” to them and by democracy
they meant what the United States Constitution did not
mean—absolute democracy.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>On this subject the <cite>State</cite> was equally vociferous. Referring to the
term human rights as “meaningless,” the Columbia newspaper in 1957
declared: “The only right with which man is endowed at birth is the
right to survive if he can. The right to vote, think freely and speak
freely” and the right of representative government “are created by
government and society.” Social Darwinism in its rawest form is not
yet dead in South Carolina.</p>

<p>Not only do the segregationists deny the validity of many of the
basic concepts of democracy but they also dispute the authority of
the federal government to assure equal treatment under the laws of
the United States to all Americans. They uphold what they consider
to be the constitutional rights of the states above human rights
as applied to the Negro. Democracy is denied to Negroes in the name
of democratic government. Harking back to the conservative nature
of the Constitution as originally written, the <cite>News and Courier</cite> thought
it “ridiculous that a document which recognized slavery” was now
being “brandished as a guarantee of all sorts of supposed rights. Did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the framers of the Constitution, who approved of slavery, sit down
and write a document guaranteeing to Negroes the right to send their
children to mixed schools?” The question of the Charleston paper
reveals more of its fetish for constitutionalism than does the answer:
“The framers didn’t guarantee Negroes anything—not even protection
from the whip!” The <cite>Record</cite>, at least recognizing that the Court
based its decision on the Fourteenth Amendment and not the original
Constitution, declared that “every student of the Constitution” knew
that the amendment “was never constitutionally submitted to the
states or constitutionally ratified” and was therefore “not today constitutionally
a part of the Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> The <cite>Record’s</cite> arguments
concerning the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment contain, of
course, an element of historical truth, but only a warped approach to
the problem of constitutionalism can hold that the Amendment is
not part of the fundamental law of the land.</p>

<p>Not only is there a considerable body of anti-democratic opinion
in the state but it is also safe to say that most white South Carolinians
consider the Negro a member of an inferior race. Dr. E. Ryan Crow,
chairman of the South Carolina education finance commission, observed,
for example, that “the white man feels he belongs to a superior
race.” To support this belief in racial superiority segregationists often
resort to science or pseudo-science. The <cite>News and Courier</cite> thought
it “curious” that many Americans had “abandoned the scientific approach
to study of the human species.” “Leaders of public opinion,”
it complained, had thrown overboard “the scientists’ cold appraisal”
and had fallen back on “sentiment, on propaganda, on political catchwords.”
Anything that tended to confirm “inherent differences among
races,” was “frowned on as ‘racism.’ Yet a large body of scientific
evidence indicates that important differences DO exist” between the
races.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>These comments by the <cite>News and Courier</cite> brought a letter of agreement
from Francis Fielding-Reid, M.D., of Charleston who warned
South Carolinians against accepting “a certain type of pseudo-scientific
balderdash.” Said the doctor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Some years ago a so-called “prominent scientist” made a statement to the
effect that the brains of people of various races had been examined anatomically
and found essentially identical, and that this indicated that there were no essential
intellectual nor emotional racial characteristics other than those caused by
environment. Such statements are puerile or are made with intent to deceive....</p>

<p>This writer has heard pseudo-scientific sophistry to the effect that, since most
deservedly prominent colored people have some white ancestry, mixing the races
is desirable in order to produce more of these individuals. Such statements, too,
are puerile and fraudulent.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Other South Carolinians expressed similar opinions. Flora Bell
Surles of Mt. Pleasant reported that ethnologists, whom she failed to
name, had “shown” that the Negro race was “as yet ‘a childlike race.’”
Gilbert Wilkes, also of Mt. Pleasant, described Negroes as belonging
to a race which had “no history, or culture, or background of training
in either social behavior or custom.” They were “only four generations
removed from the trackless jungle” where they had lived “for
countless thousands of years, without any development and in many
cases without even having devised a language.”<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> Harold A. Petit of
Charleston, vice-president and regional manager for the South Carolina
Electric and Gas Company and past national president of Exchange
Clubs, declared: “The Negro is irresponsible in every degree.
I think it is a basic trait, although other conditions—environment,
economics and education—contribute to his so-called lethargy.”<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>A “Dirt Farmer” from “Rural South Carolina” expressed in the
<cite>News and Courier</cite> the sentiments of the state’s most extreme racists.
Conceding that segregation could not be “theoretically defended upon
the basis of any code of ethics,” he nonetheless favored it because “like
Hitler,” he believed “that the Aryan people are superior to any other
who have yet trod the face of this earth during the period of recorded
history, that they have the inherent ability to contribute more to the
future well-being of mankind than any other.” What were the Aryan’s
points of superiority, according to the “Dirt Farmer?” Their “curiosity:
the desire to know for the sake of knowledge itself;” their
“urge to reshape the world more to their own liking;” and their “seeking
and finding newer and truer answers” to the problems of civilization.
In the interest of impartiality he searched for points of superiority in
the Negro. He could find only one—“a more highly developed sense
of rhythm.” If the attributes of the Aryans were ever merged “with
those of their inferiors, that fatal error can never be redeemed,” he
concluded. Mankind’s slow progress would end “and the wave of
the future” would push him “inexorably back into darkness and oblivion.”<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>Logical inconsistency is the most striking characteristic of the many
statements made in defense of racial segregation. The aforegoing
pages have made this manifestly clear. But then who is logical when
it comes to the question of racial superiority? Adolf Hitler, Joseph
Goebbels and their like were living proof that logic really didn’t matter.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> Judge Waring is one of the most interesting personalities encountered in the
study of the race issue in South Carolina. Senator “Cotton Ed” Smith’s campaign
manager in 1938, he was representative of the most “respectable” elements of
Charleston society, was “a descendant of Confederates,” and had the support of
the most orthodox of white supremacists when he was made a federal judge by
President Roosevelt. After his decisions outlawing the white primary (and also
after his divorce and remarriage to an “outsider” with “radical” views on the race
question) he was completely ostracized by white Charleston and South Carolina
society. He and his wife became complete integrationists. “The Southern advocates
of white supremacy,” he said, “are mentally sick.” “We don’t have a
Negro problem in the South, we have a white problem.” <cite>New York Times</cite>,

provisions for state right-to-work laws. Other economic interests, e.g. oil interests,
also supported the movement. Nevertheless the revolt was sold to the rank and

this was the main consideration.</p>

to arouse the American people.” He denied that he had broken any agreement
with his fellow Southern senators. He contended that the caucus had agreed
against an organized filibuster but permitted each individual Senator to “oppose
the bill in his own way.” According to Thurmond, “Senator Russell said it
would be up to each Senator as to how long he would talk, so a Senator was free
to make a long speech if he chose to do so. I chose to make a long one and told
Senator Russell in his office the following Wednesday that I was going to make
a long speech face.... I spoke 24 hours and 20 minutes and do not think it was too

Johnston, nettled by the filibuster of his colleague, sent out a circular letter to

of his own, Johnston referred to the various criticisms of Thurmond’s action made
by his Senatorial colleagues from the South.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The following is the text of the decision, read by Chief Justice Earl Warren,
in the case of <cite>Briggs v. Elliott</cite> (in conjunction with cases from Kansas, Virginia
and Delaware) on May 17, 1954:</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>These cases come to us from the States of Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia,
and Delaware. They are premised on different facts and different local conditions,
but a common legal question justifies their consideration together in
this consolidated opinion.</p>

<p>In each of the cases, minors of the Negro race, through their legal representatives,
seek the aid of the courts in obtaining admission to the public schools
of their community on a nonsegregated basis. In each instance, they had been
denied admission to schools attended by white children under laws requiring
or permitting segregation according to race. This segregation was alleged to
deprive the plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth
Amendment. In each of the cases other than the Delaware case, a three-judge
federal district court denied relief to the plaintiffs on the so-called “separate
but equal” doctrine announced by this Court in <cite>Plessy v. Ferguson</cite>, 163 U.S. 537.
Under that doctrine, equality of treatment is accorded when the races are provided
substantially equal facilities, even though these facilities be separate.
In the Delaware case, the Supreme Court of Delaware adhered to that doctrine,
but ordered that the plaintiffs be admitted to the white schools because of
their superiority to the Negro schools.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs contend that segregated public schools are not “equal” and
cannot be made “equal,” and that hence they are deprived of the equal protection
of the laws. Because of the obvious importance of the question presented
the Court took jurisdiction. Argument was heard in the 1952 Term, and reargument
was heard this Term on certain questions propounded by the Court.</p>

<p>Reargument was largely devoted to the circumstances surrounding the adoption
of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. It covered exhaustively consideration
of the Amendment in Congress, ratification by the states, then existing practices
in racial segregation, and the views of proponents and opponents of the
Amendment. This discussion and our own investigation convinced us that although
these sources cast some light, it is not enough to resolve the problem
with which we are faced. At best, they are inconclusive. The most avid proponents
of the post-War Amendments undoubtedly intended them to remove
all legal distinctions among “all persons born or naturalized in the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
States.” Their opponents, just as certainly, were antagonistic to both the letter
and the spirit of the Amendments and wished them to have the most limited
effect. What others in Congress and the state legislatures had in mind cannot
be determined with any degree of certainty.</p>

<p>An additional reason for the inconclusive nature of the Amendment’s history,
with respect to segregated schools, is the status of public education at that time.
In the South, the movement toward free common schools, supported by general
taxation, had not yet taken hold. Education of white children was largely in
the hands of private groups. Education of Negroes was almost nonexistent, and
practically all of the race were illiterate. In fact, any education of Negroes
was forbidden by law in some states. Today, in contrast, many Negroes have
achieved outstanding success in the arts and sciences as well as in the business
and professional world. It is true that public education had already
advanced further in the North, but the effect of the Amendment on Northern
States was generally ignored in the congressional debates. Even in the North,
the conditions of public education did not approximate those existing today.
The curriculum was usually rudimentary; ungraded schools were common in
rural areas; the school term was but three months a year in many states; and
compulsory school attendance was virtually unknown. As a consequence, it is
not surprising that there should be so little in the history of the Fourteenth
Amendment relating to its intended effect on public education.</p>

<p>In the first cases in this Court construing the Fourteenth Amendment, decided
shortly after its adoption, the Court interpreted it as proscribing all state-imposed
discriminations against the Negro race. The doctrine of “separate but equal”
did not make its appearance in this Court until 1896 in the case of <cite>Plessy v.
Ferguson</cite>, <i lang="la">supra</i>, involving not education but transportation. American courts
have since labored with the doctrine for over half a century. In this Court,
there have been six cases involving the “separate but equal” doctrine in the
field of public education. In <cite>Cumming v. County Board of Education</cite>, 175 U.S.
528, and <cite>Gong Lum v. Rice</cite>, 275 U.S. 78, the validity of the doctrine itself was
not challenged. In more recent cases, all on the graduate school level, inequality
was found in that specific benefits enjoyed by white students were denied to
Negro students of the same educational qualifications. <cite>Missouri ex rel. Gaines
v. Canada</cite>, 305. U.S. 337; <cite>Sipuel v. Oklahoma</cite>, 332 U.S. 631; <cite>Sweatt v. Painter</cite>,
339 U.S. 629; <cite>McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents</cite>, 339 U.S. 637. In none of
these cases was it necessary to re-examine the doctrine to grant relief to the
Negro plaintiff. And in <cite>Sweatt v. Painter</cite>, <i lang="la">supra</i>, the Court expressly reserved
decision on the question whether <cite>Plessy v. Ferguson</cite> should be held inapplicable
to public education.</p>

<p>In the instant cases, that question is directly presented. Here, unlike <cite>Sweatt
v. Painter</cite>, there are findings below that the Negro and white schools involved
have been equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to buildings, curricula,
qualifications and salaries of teachers, and other “tangible” factors. Our decision,
therefore, cannot turn on merely a comparison of these tangible factors
in the Negro and white schools involved in each of the cases. We must look
instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education.</p>

<p>In approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock back to 1868 when
the Amendment was adopted, or even to 1896 when <cite>Plessy v. Ferguson</cite> was
written. We must consider public education in the light of its full development
and its present place in American life throughout the Nation. Only in this way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
can it be determined if segregation in public schools deprives these plaintiffs
of the equal protection of the laws.</p>

<p>Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local
governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures
for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education
to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic
public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation
of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the
child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in
helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful
that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the
opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken
to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.</p>

<p>We come then to the question presented: Does segregation of children in
public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities
and other “tangible” factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority
group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.</p>

<p>In <cite>Sweatt v. Painter</cite>, <i lang="la">supra</i>, in finding that a segregated law school for Negroes
could not provide them equal educational opportunities, this Court relied in
large part on “those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement
but which make for greatness in a law school.” In <cite>McLaurin v. Oklahoma State
Regents</cite>, <i lang="la">supra</i>, the Court, in requiring that a Negro admitted to a white graduate
school be treated like all other students, again resorted to intangible considerations:</p>

<p>“... his ability to study, to engage in discussions and exchange views with other
students, and, in general, to learn his profession.” Such considerations apply
with added force to children in grade and high schools. To separate them from
others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a
feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their
hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. The effect of this separation
on their educational opportunities was well stated by a finding in the
Kansas case by a court which nevertheless felt compelled to rule against the
Negro plaintiffs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental
effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has
the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted
as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group. A sense of inferiority
affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of
law, therefore, has a tendency to retard the educational and mental development
of Negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they
would receive in a racially integrated school system.”</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Whatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time
of <cite>Plessy v. Ferguson</cite>, this finding is amply supported by modern authority.
Any language in <cite>Plessy v. Ferguson</cite> contrary to this finding is rejected.</p>

<p>We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of “separate
but equal” has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.
Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom
the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of,
deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
Amendment. This disposition makes unnecessary any discussion whether such
segregation also violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>Because these are class actions, because of the wide applicability of this decision
and because of the great variety of local conditions, the formulation of
decrees in these cases presents problems of considerable complexity. On reargument,
the consideration of appropriate relief was necessarily subordinated to the
primary question—the constitutionality of segregation in public education. We
have now announced that such segregation is a denial of the equal protection
of the laws. In order that we may have the full assistance of the parties in
formulating decrees, the cases will be restored to the docket, and the parties
are requested to present further argument on Questions 4 and 5 previously propounded
by the Court for reargument this Term. The Attorney General of the
United States is again invited to participate. The Attorneys General of the
states requiring or permitting segregaion in public education will also be permitted
to appear as <i lang="la">amici curiae</i> upon request to do so by September 15, 1954,
and submission of briefs by October 1, 1954.</p>

<h4>Transcriber’s Note:</h4>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged unless indicated below. Misspelled words were not
corrected.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially. Obvious printing errors,
such as backwards, upside down, or partially printed letters and
punctuation were corrected. Final stops missing at the end of sentences
and abbreviations were added. Duplicate letters at line endings were
removed.</p>

<p>The following was changed: &emsp; “as” to <a href="#chg1">“is”</a>:<br>
... is, in itself, unconstitutional,...</p>
